In the dense jungles of West Africa, a series of extraordinary events unfold, centering around the life of Tarzan, a man raised by apes. The story begins with Lord John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, and his wife, Lady Alice, who are marooned on the African coast after a mutiny on their ship. They build a small cabin to survive, but tragically, both die, leaving behind their infant son.

This child is discovered by Kala, a female ape, who adopts him after losing her own offspring. The boy, named Tarzan by the apes, grows up in the jungle, learning the ways of the wild. He becomes extremely agile and strong, mastering the art of swinging through trees and hunting with a knife he finds in his parents' cabin. Tarzan's human intelligence sets him apart from his ape family, allowing him to learn to read from the books left in the cabin, although he cannot speak any human language.

Tarzan's life takes a dramatic turn when he encounters a group of black warriors who have settled near his jungle home. After they kill Kala, Tarzan's ape mother, he vows revenge. He kills Kulonga, the warrior responsible for Kala's death, demonstrating his lethal prowess and the cunning he has developed in the jungle.

Meanwhile, a group of Europeans, including Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, his daughter Jane, and her suitor William Cecil Clayton, arrive on the coast near Tarzan's jungle. They are searching for treasure and scientific knowledge. Jane Porter captures Tarzan's heart, and he saves her from numerous dangers, including wild animals and hostile natives. Despite the language barrier, a bond forms between Tarzan and Jane, complicated by her engagement to Clayton and the societal expectations they both face.

Tarzan's identity is revealed through a series of events. Lieutenant D'Arnot, a French naval officer whom Tarzan rescues, teaches him to speak French and eventually helps him discover his true heritage as John Clayton, Lord Greystoke. This revelation presents Tarzan with a choice between his jungle life and the civilized world.

The novel explores themes of nature versus nurture, the essence of civilization, and the struggle for identity. Tarzan's journey from an ape-man to a nobleman raises questions about what it means to be human and the inherent instincts that define us. The story concludes with Tarzan's internal conflict unresolved, as he grapples with his love for Jane and his place in the world.
