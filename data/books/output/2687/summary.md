In a narrative set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars, Sir Terence O'Moy, the Irish adjutant-general in Lisbon, grapples with both personal and professional turmoil. The story unfolds with the news of Lieutenant Richard Butler's scandalous escapade at a convent in Tavora, which becomes a significant point of contention and concern for O'Moy. Butler, who is O'Moy's brother-in-law, has gone missing after the incident, and his actions threaten to exacerbate tensions between the British forces and the Portuguese government.

O'Moy is depicted as a man torn between his duties and his family obligations. His wife, Lady Una O'Moy, is portrayed as a delicate and somewhat frivolous woman, deeply concerned about her brother Richard but not fully grasping the gravity of his situation. O'Moy, on the other hand, is acutely aware of the political ramifications and the potential for scandal, which could undermine the British military efforts in Portugal.

Captain Ned Tremayne, O'Moy's military secretary and a close family friend, becomes embroiled in the affair as he tries to navigate the delicate situation. Tremayne's own feelings for Sylvia Armytage, Lady O'Moy's cousin, add another layer of complexity to the narrative. Sylvia, intelligent and perceptive, becomes a confidante and advisor to her cousin, warning her against trusting the suave but potentially duplicitous Count Samoval, who offers assistance regarding Richard Butler's predicament.

Samoval, a Portuguese nobleman with his own intrigues, is revealed to be involved in a broader conspiracy against the British. He is shown to be in league with other Portuguese dissidents, including the Marquis of Minas, who oppose Wellington's harsh but strategically necessary policies of devastation to thwart the French invasion. This subplot highlights the intricate web of political and military intrigue that characterizes the period.

As the story progresses, O'Moy's suspicions and jealousy regarding his wife's relationship with Tremayne are exacerbated by circumstantial evidence and his own insecurities. This jealousy, combined with the pressures of his position and the looming threat of a French invasion, creates a volatile mix that threatens to unravel both his personal and professional life.

The narrative also touches on the broader strategic context of the war, with Wellington's plans to fortify the lines of Torres Vedras and create a defensive barrier against the advancing French forces under Marshal Massena. The tension between the necessity of these harsh measures and the resistance from the Portuguese nobility adds depth to the story, reflecting the complex interplay of personal, political, and military challenges faced by the characters.

In the end, O'Moy's internal and external conflicts are brought to a head, forcing him to confront the consequences of his actions and the choices he must make to protect his family, his honor, and his duty to his country. The narrative weaves together themes of loyalty, honor, love, and betrayal, set against the backdrop of a nation at war, highlighting the personal costs of political and military decisions.
