In an era marked by the decline of traditional Roman religion and the rise of new philosophical and religious ideas, Marius, a young Roman, embarks on a journey of intellectual and spiritual exploration. Raised in a rural villa with an old-fashioned devotion to the Roman gods, Marius experiences a sheltered childhood, steeped in the rituals and traditions of his ancestors. His father's adherence to the "religion of Numa," a patriarchal and pastoral form of Roman paganism, instills in Marius a sense of duty and reverence towards the divine, which shapes his early life.

As Marius matures, he is sent to Pisa to study under a renowned rhetorician, where he forms a deep friendship with Flavian, a charismatic and ambitious youth. Flavian introduces Marius to the literary and philosophical currents of the time, including the works of Apuleius, whose "Golden Book" captivates them both. The story of Cupid and Psyche within the book, with its themes of love, beauty, and the soul's journey, deeply influences Marius, reinforcing his appreciation for the aesthetic and the ideal.

Tragedy strikes when Flavian succumbs to a mysterious plague brought to Rome by the returning armies of Lucius Verus. Flavian's death profoundly affects Marius, leading him to question the nature of the soul and the afterlife. In his grief, Marius turns to philosophy, seeking answers in the teachings of Heraclitus and the Cyrenaics. Heraclitus's doctrine of perpetual change and the Cyrenaic focus on the present moment resonate with Marius, who begins to adopt a philosophy centered on the pursuit of immediate experience and the refinement of the senses.

Marius's intellectual journey leads him to embrace a form of Epicureanism, emphasizing the cultivation of personal experience and the pursuit of beauty and sensation. He is drawn to the idea of living fully in the present, appreciating the fleeting nature of life, and seeking fulfillment through art, culture, and the pleasures of the mind and body. This philosophy of life, which he terms "New Cyrenaicism," becomes his guiding principle, as he seeks to balance the demands of the intellect with the desires of the heart.

Amidst the philosophical explorations, Marius receives a summons to Rome, where he intends to pursue a career as a rhetorician. The prospect of life in the bustling capital, with its rich cultural and intellectual opportunities, excites him. He envisions a life dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and the expression of beauty, guided by the principles of his newly adopted philosophy.

Throughout his journey, Marius remains a figure of introspection and refinement, seeking to live a life of elegance and depth in a world that is increasingly uncertain and complex. His story is one of personal growth and philosophical inquiry, set against the backdrop of a Roman Empire in transition, where old beliefs are challenged, and new ideas take root.
