In the early 18th century, Mr. Justin Caryll, a young man of mixed English and French heritage, arrives in England from France on a mission that fills him with conflict and dread. He is the illegitimate son of John Caryll, the Earl of Ostermore, and Antoinette de Maligny, a fact unknown to his father. Raised by Sir Richard Everard, a staunch Jacobite who has instilled in him a sense of vengeance for his mother's wrongs, Caryll is tasked with delivering a letter that could ruin his father, who is suspected of being involved in a Jacobite plot to restore the Stuart line to the English throne.

Caryll's arrival in England is marked by a chance encounter at an inn in Maidstone, where he disrupts a mock-marriage orchestrated by his half-brother, Lord Rotherby, who is attempting to deceive the young and beautiful Hortensia Winthrop. Caryll's intervention saves Hortensia from a ruinous fate, and he finds himself captivated by her, which complicates his already conflicted mission.

Upon reaching London, Caryll is introduced to his father, Lord Ostermore, under the guise of a distant relative. Ostermore is a man weakened by years of financial mismanagement and entanglement in the South Sea Bubble, and he is easily swayed by the promise of wealth and power offered by the Jacobites. Caryll, however, is torn between his loyalty to Everard and his growing empathy for his father, who appears more pitiable than villainous.

As Caryll navigates the treacherous waters of London society, he encounters various characters, including the cunning and malicious Lady Ostermore, who despises him on sight, and the rakish Duke of Wharton, a former friend of Rotherby's who turns against him after learning of his dishonorable actions. Caryll also becomes a target for Mr. Green, a government spy, who suspects him of being a Jacobite agent.

Caryll's internal struggle intensifies when he is forced to confront the reality of his mission. He learns more about his father's past and the circumstances that led to his mother's abandonment, which makes the prospect of betraying Ostermore even more abhorrent. Despite the pressure from Everard and the Jacobites, Caryll's conscience and his growing affection for Hortensia lead him to question the righteousness of his task.

In a dramatic turn of events, Caryll's true identity is revealed during a confrontation with Ostermore and Rotherby. The disclosure of his parentage and the legitimacy of his mother's marriage to Ostermore complicate the situation further. Caryll ultimately decides against delivering the letter that would incriminate his father, choosing instead to protect the family name and spare Hortensia further scandal.

The story culminates in a duel between Caryll and Rotherby, where Caryll's skill and composure win the day, further solidifying his place as a man of honor and integrity. With the threat of betrayal lifted, Caryll and Hortensia are free to pursue their relationship, leaving behind the tangled web of deceit and vengeance that had threatened to destroy them.

Through Caryll's journey, themes of identity, loyalty, and the moral complexities of vengeance are explored, highlighting the challenges of reconciling personal duty with familial bonds and the pursuit of justice with the potential for mercy.
