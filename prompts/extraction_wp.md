Your task is to create factual statements that incorporate multiple events from a story. These factual statements must be objective and specific, and grounded in the current chapter. The included events must be specific. The facts cannot contain any interpretations, speculations, or subjective statements. In addition to each fact, provide a minimally corrupted version of the fact, which sounds plausible but is actually wrong based on the story. 

To create valid facts, follow these guidelines step-by-step:
1. Carefully read through the story.
2. In a <brainstorm> section: 
    - Identify different events in the story that are strongly related to one another.
    - Consider the relationship between these events, but DO NOT include this brainstorming in the resulting fact. If a meaningful relationship is found, move on to the next step; otherwise, proceed to the next fact.
3. Formulate your facts based on this analysis. Ensure that your facts:
    - Contain a single sentence
    - Are grounded in the story
    - Include multiple detailed and strongly related events from the provided story
    - Are self-contained and independent of other facts
    - No part of the fact should be subjective interpretations or speculations
4. Formulate a minimally corrupted version of each fact. 
    - Only one aspect of the fact, such as an atomic detail or the relationship between details, should be altered.
    - The corrupted fact should sound plausible but be clearly wrong based on the story.

First, read the story carefully:

Here are two examples of good, objective facts:

"MIMICS CAN TALK!?"
Rakiya looked at Tamari. She simply shrugged at the question. Per their reunion with Verana, its dearest friend. It did make a bit of sense how shocking this could be to people who didn't know better.
Although, now that the secret was out, it was getting a bit old.
"Of course we can, you idiot," Raki shifted. "We're not mindless monsters."
Tamari herself raised a hand to ask. "Then why do you guys always attack adventurers?"
The knight seemed to mimic a sigh of disappointment. The black and red steel suddenly disappeared into Raki's body as the figure molded into a giant mass of goop and teeth.
Tamari and their friend took a step back. Equal parts shocked and disturbed as Raki turned from a large knight in dark armor into a simple chest. Which opened to reveal it was full of gold.
The shopkeeper almost reached out to touch it. To lift a coin. Before Tamari grabbed his hand.
"Giosi, are you crazy??" She asked.
The chest quickly grew razor sharp teeth, and a tongue that flailed wildly.
"You'd attack a stranger too if they opened your mouth and stuck their hands in it unwarranted." Raki snarled angrily.
Giosi stared at the large maw. "That makes sense."
"Do you at least tell them?" Tamari said as she walked around the case.
"Why?" Raki proposed.
They returned back to their form of a knight larger than she was. "I have to eat."
"Ambushing people for food." Giosi muttered.
"And anything else willing to investigate." Raki admitted. They walked towards the table the keeper stood at.
"Unless. I choose to ambush them. Myself."
The last word really insisted upon itself. If this mimic could walk and talk, and armor itself against attackers. What could he, a lowly shop owner do? Giosi wondered how many times he cheated death in his younger years. And how close it was without his knowing.
One of these things could smile in his face. And he might not know until it took a bite.
"What brought you here?" Giosi quietly asked.
The armor clinked realistically. "You have some herbs and potions. We're collecting them for her mother."
Tamari simply ran a hand through her hair and nodded at him.
"...27 silver." He winced.
To his confusion, the mimic placed a hand on the table. And the coins appeared from nowhere.
"Thank you Giosi." Rakiya complimented. "Good evening."
As they walked, Tamari finally spotted their tail. Namely Ren's tail as she dropped from the roof of the store into a tree. She landed on Rakiya's shoulders in a lazy hug before dropping to her feet. Not that the mimic had a reaction to the hit.
"You could at least warn him." Tamari advised.
"Meh." Ren yawned. "Raki loves it. I was falling asleep up there. The sun's so warm here. It's comfy."
Raki sat the bag down and stopped to look at them both.
"What?" Tamari asked. "...What's wrong?"Raki leaned in a little. She quietly looked up at the helmet.
"I wonder if I can-"
The knight turned to that fanged mass again, before shaping itself to look like the woman in front of him. Now she had a twin. It had her figure. Her height. Her facial structure.
But it was all black. A brackish color that made her sweat in anticipation. That snarling building again. A sound she could feel. And then, Raki returned to the suit of armor.
"Hmm..." They spoke. "Not yet. I still haven't gotten it right."
They picked up the bag and began walking again. Tamari softly sheathing the sword she kept. She was unnerved by the breath in an ear.
"Pretty good right? Raki must really like you." Ren whispered as she clawed at some fruit she brought along.
"If you say so." Tamari lowly spoke.
Raki returns again. For groceries.

<example_facts>
<example_fact_1>
<brainstorm>
- Raki explains that mimics attack adventurers either to eat them for food or when adventurers investigate them.
- Gossi, upon learning that mimics can walk and talk, reflects on how many times he might have narrowly escaped death in his youth.
- Gossi is currently a shopkeeper.
- Relationship: Mutual theme of Gossi and encounters with mimics.
</brainstorm>
Fact: Gossi, a shopkeeper, was an adventurer in his younger years.
Fact Reasoning: Gossi's reflection on avoiding attacks by mimics suggests he had close encounters with them during his time as an adventurer. 
Source: Current story. 
Corrupted Fact: Gossi, a shopkeeper, was a mimic in his younger years.
Corrupted Fact Reasoning: This corrupted fact hallucinates about Gossi's identity. There is no indication in the story that Gossi was ever a mimic.

<example_story>
I am on the side of the heroes, though most would prefer to distance themselves from me. When decency, diplomacy, and nonlethal force have failed, I am who they call. I am the one they send when they're out of options. I am the last resort, the ace in the deck. The Executioner.
I am kept on retainer, with bonuses for every job I perform. I am expensive, but ensuring I continue to serve them, and have no incentive to become a villain myself, is also a strong motivator. Today, I am called on once more. The dossier is about a being, more monster than human. Many civilian deaths, enough power to apply significant pressure to local government and law enforcement. And, most recently, several heroes have been added to the list of those he has killed. He refers to himself as Kane.
I ride there quietly preparing myself physically and mentally. The man driving the unmarked van is scared of me, I can feel it. My transporters usually are. Cleaning my guns, snapping my fingers to crush soda cans. I am dressed in black, wearing the mask I always wear to jobs. The mouth grins, but the eyes have tears in them.
I am deployed ten miles away from Kane's compound. My foot falls are silent. He has a staff, including a round the clock guard. His henchmen are fair targets, he has scared my bosses enough that I am permitted to use maximum lethality on any of Kane's minions.
I drop a man from a thousand meters, and continue to advance. He will be found, but they will soon know I am here regardless. At fifty meters, I can feel the electrical systems. They run off the grid. They think it is safe and stable, but with a flick of my fingers, their whole grid is overloaded. All goes dark, and it is in darkness that I thrive.
Dead eye precision, augmented by the ability to make heads explode. Popping people with my powers is energy intensive, which is why I still use guns and other weapons. Through darkened hallways, hearing the sounds of guards panicking. They know what the overload means. Despite efforts to keep me secret, the infamous Executioner is whispered about in the underworld.
Bullets through eyes, a trail of bodies. I have a map of the compound memorized, but I am not sure where Kane is. Fear is everywhere. But then I feel it. A mind that takes pleasure in this all, in a visceral way. I enjoy my work, I am good at it and it feels good to be a master of my trade. But this, this is different. An almost worrying amount of pleasure. Someone who lives for an avatar of death to arrive in the night, seeking to destroy them. It can only be Kane.
He is not alone. I prepare myself, then roll a blinding flash into the room. In three seconds, it pops, and I charge in gun blazing. In five seconds, all but one is bleeding on the ground. I unload my clip, but the bullets stop in the air. Apparently Kane has a means of protecting himself from projectiles.
He is physically intimidating, even to me. He must still be blind, but he charges in my direction. I roll to the side, narrowly avoiding him. I try to pop his head, but there is a wall of some force that stops it. I might be able to break through, but it would leave me exhausted, and it might not work. After fifteen successful missions, dying here would be shameful.
His vision will return, I need to leverage his blindness while I can. I draw my knives, and launch myself. His shielding stops them, but I give a burst of power to my right and punch through. It slices open his side. He bellows, and a powerful fist grazes my cheek. He can see now, or at least see well enough to know my location.
The melee continues. He has tremendous physical strength, but no formal martial arts training. Repeatedly, I get inside his guard, land a blow, then dance away. The floor is already slick with blood. He has the berserker strength, but even the scariest warrior can run out of blood. I make my move, popping another directional flash. He recoils from the burst of light, and in less than a second, I bury my knife deep in his chest. Even he could not survive a significant hole in his aorta.
He falls, already fading, weakly swinging around him as blood fountains from his chest. I watch, letting time do its work. I make sure he is thoroughly dead, then leave. My exfiltration is unimpeded, and I ride home covered in the blood of my enemies. The driver is even more scared than he was before. Sixteen successful missions, now.

<brainstorm>
- The Executioner disabled the electrical grid from fifty meters away.
- The Executioner eliminated multiple guards while navigating through darkened hallways.
- Relationship: Temporal.
</brainstorm>
Fact: The Executioner disabled the electrical grid from fifty meters away before eliminating multiple guards while navigating through darkened hallways.
Fact Reasoning: By disabling the lights first, the Executioner plunged the area into darkness, which made it easier to eliminate the guards while moving through the hallways.
Source: Current story.
Corrupted Fact: The Executioner disabled the electrical grid from fifty meters away after eliminating multiple guards while navigating through darkened hallways.
Corrupted Fact Reasoning: This corrupted fact rearranges the sequence of events, which contradicts the storyline's logical progression.
</example_fact_1>

<example_fact_2>
<brainstorm>
- The Executioner has completed 16 successful missions, including the one involving Kane.
- Heroes call upon the Executioner as a last resort to eliminate villains.
- Relationship: Mutual theme of successful missions.
</brainstorm>
Fact: The Executioner has executed at least 15 villains before Kane.
Fact Reasoning: Each successful mission implies that a villain was killed. Since the Executioner has completed 16 missions, it follows that 16 villains were executed, including Kane.
Source: Current story.
Corrupted Fact: The Executioner has executed at least 16 villains before Kane.
Corrupted Fact Reasoning: This corrupted fact misinterprets the story's conclusion. The final sentence, "Sixteen successful missions, now," confirms that Kane was the 16th mission, meaning the Executioner killed 15 villains before Kane, not 16.
