The Willis family is adjusting to life without their mother, who is away at a sanatorium for a year to recover from an illness. The household is managed by Winnie, the longtime housekeeper, and Aunt Trudy Wright, who comes to stay with the family. The children, Rosemary, Sarah, and Shirley, each have their own distinct personalities and challenges. Rosemary, the eldest, tries to be responsible, but struggles with her temper and desire for independence. Sarah, with her fascination for animals, often finds herself in trouble due to her stubbornness and strong will. Shirley, the youngest, is prone to running away, causing concern for her siblings and Aunt Trudy.

Dr. Hugh Willis, the children's older brother, has returned home to take over Dr. Jordan's medical practice while also managing the household. He faces the challenge of balancing his professional responsibilities with the need to guide and discipline his sisters. He emphasizes the importance of obedience and the proper exercise of the "Willis will," a strong family trait that can be both a virtue and a source of conflict.

Throughout the story, the children learn valuable lessons about responsibility, obedience, and the consequences of their actions. Rosemary, in particular, learns the hard way about the importance of listening to her brother's guidance after she impulsively cuts her hair against his wishes, only to regret it immediately. She also grapples with her friendship with Nina Edmonds, realizing that not all friendships are beneficial.

As the year progresses, the children face various challenges, from Sarah's mischievous behavior to Shirley's running away. Dr. Hugh's firm but understanding approach helps them navigate these difficulties, teaching them about loyalty, honesty, and the importance of family.

The story culminates with the anticipation of their mother's return, which motivates the children to strive for good behavior and personal growth. The narrative highlights the dynamics of a family working together to overcome adversity and the importance of love and guidance in shaping young lives.
