Payton Street, once a symbol of gentility, has become a shadow of its former self, with only the Payton family remaining as a link to its past. The street is now lined with lodgers and small businesses, and the Payton household itself is a place of faded grandeur, marked by an old brownstone house with a neglected yard and an iron dog statue. Mrs. Payton, nostalgic for the past, often reminisces about the time when the street was lively and respectable, contrasting it with the present decline.

Frederica "Freddy" Payton, Mrs. Payton's daughter, is a modern, independent young woman who is critical of her mother's attachment to the past. Despite having the means to move to a more fashionable area, the Paytons remain on Payton Street, partly due to Mrs. Payton's sense of duty to her son Mortimore, who is intellectually disabled. Freddy is determined to live her own life, rejecting the traditional roles expected of her.

The story unfolds with a visit from Mrs. William Childs, Mrs. Payton's sister-in-law, who is concerned about Freddy's behavior and her involvement with Howard Maitland, a young man from a respectable family. Freddy's rebellious nature and desire for independence are highlighted by her disdain for the conventional life her mother leads. She is determined to carve out her own path, even if it means defying societal expectations.

Freddy's relationship with Howard Maitland is a central focus. Howard, a well-meaning but somewhat conventional young man, is intrigued by Freddy's independence and modern ideas. However, Freddy's refusal to conform to traditional female roles creates tension between her and the older generation, who view her behavior as unbecoming.

Throughout the narrative, Freddy is portrayed as a symbol of the new woman, challenging the status quo and seeking to redefine her identity outside the confines of marriage and domesticity. Her interactions with her mother, Mrs. Childs, and Howard reveal the generational and ideological conflicts that arise as society transitions from old to new values.

The story is set against the backdrop of a changing world, where the old ways are being questioned, and new possibilities are emerging for women like Freddy. Her struggle to balance her desire for independence with the expectations of those around her reflects the broader societal shifts taking place during this period. Freddy's journey is one of self-discovery, as she navigates the complexities of love, duty, and personal freedom in a world that is slowly embracing change.
