Alice Adams, a young woman from a modest background, navigates the complexities of social status and personal aspirations in a rapidly changing world. Her father, Virgil Adams, works at Lamb and Company, a well-established wholesale drug business, where he is considered a reliable employee but not indispensable. Despite his steady job, the family's financial situation is strained, leading to tensions at home, particularly between Alice's parents, who have differing views on how to improve their circumstances.

Alice, aware of her social standing, often feels out of place among her wealthier peers. She attends social events with the hope of finding a suitable match, but her efforts are frequently met with disappointment. At a dance hosted by her friend Mildred Palmer, Alice struggles with feelings of inadequacy and the realization that she is not as popular as she once was. Her brother Walter, who is supposed to accompany her, is more interested in his own pursuits and provides little support.

Throughout the story, Alice grapples with the expectations placed upon her by society and her own desires for a better life. She dreams of a more glamorous existence and considers pursuing a career on the stage, believing she has the talent to succeed. However, her father's skepticism about such ambitions and her own doubts about the feasibility of this path leave her feeling trapped.

Virgil Adams, meanwhile, faces his own challenges. He is pressured by his wife to find a more lucrative position, but he is reluctant to leave the security of his current job. His health suffers due to the stress, and he experiences a breakdown, which prompts a visit from his old employer, J. A. Lamb. Lamb offers to buy Virgil's struggling glue business, providing the family with a financial lifeline, though it means giving up on the venture Virgil hoped would secure their future.

As Alice comes to terms with the realities of her situation, she begins to see the limitations of her dreams and the necessity of finding a practical path forward. Her encounter with Arthur Russell, a well-off and attractive young man, further complicates her emotions, as she realizes that her hopes of marrying into wealth may be unrealistic.

Ultimately, Alice's journey is one of self-discovery and acceptance. She learns to navigate the social dynamics of her world while coming to terms with her family's position and her own aspirations. The novel explores themes of ambition, social class, and the pursuit of happiness, highlighting the challenges faced by individuals striving for a better life in a society that often values appearances over substance.
