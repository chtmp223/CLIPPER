Philip Morgan, known as Whistler, and his friends Al Torrance, Michael Donahue, and Ikey Rosenmeyer, all young seamen apprentices in the Navy, are on furlough in their hometown of Seacove. They are eager to recruit others for the Navy amidst the ongoing war. The boys, including their friend Hans Hertig, nicknamed Seven Knott, who is recovering from a wound, are particularly interested in convincing young men from Elmvale, a nearby factory town, to enlist.

During a trip to Elmvale, Whistler observes a suspicious man named Blake, who works at the local munition factory. Blake is seen examining the Elmvale Dam through a field-glass, sparking Whistler’s curiosity and suspicion. Whistler later discovers a small water wheel hidden under a rock at the foot of the dam, which seems to be connected to a mechanical contrivance. This discovery, combined with Blake’s behavior, leads Whistler to suspect that something nefarious might be happening.

The boys’ furlough is interrupted when they are called to join the crew of the new superdreadnaught, the _Kennebunk_, under Ensign MacMasters. Before leaving, Whistler tries to report his suspicions about Blake and the dam to Mr. Santley, the factory manager, but the situation escalates when the dam is suddenly blown up, resulting in a flood that devastates Elmvale.

The boys, along with Ensign MacMasters, are soon aboard the _Kennebunk_, which is preparing for a significant mission. During the voyage, they engage in gun drills and encounter a German submarine, which they successfully destroy. However, rumors of a "ghost-clock" aboard the ship unsettle the crew. Whistler deduces that the ticking sound is an infernal machine planted by a saboteur, and with the help of the warrant officer, they locate and disable the device, preventing a potential disaster.

The _Kennebunk_ is then ordered to join a large naval fleet for a major operation against the German Navy. The fleet successfully lures the German ships into battle, and the _Kennebunk_ plays a crucial role, sinking two enemy vessels. After the battle, Whistler and his friends are reassigned to their old ship, the _Colodia_, which is now part of the destroyer fleet hunting German submarines in the Bay of Biscay.

Throughout their adventures, the boys demonstrate courage and quick thinking, from Whistler's initial suspicions about Blake to their actions aboard the _Kennebunk_. Their experiences highlight the dangers and responsibilities of naval service during wartime, as well as the importance of vigilance and teamwork. The story concludes with the boys eagerly anticipating their next assignment, ready to continue their service in the Navy.
