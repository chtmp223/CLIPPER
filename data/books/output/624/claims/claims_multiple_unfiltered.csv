2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship suggests a causal or sequential transition from one economic system to another. However, the claim does not explicitly state that the narrator's system was directly replaced by the consolidation of businesses. The summary and outline describe these as separate historical developments without a direct causal link.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation, as the claim implies a direct replacement that is not explicitly stated in the summary or outline.
