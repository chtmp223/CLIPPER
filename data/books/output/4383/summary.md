In the remote village of Peribonka, nestled along the icy banks of the Peribonka River, the men of the congregation gather outside the church, exchanging greetings and news. Among them is Cleophas Pesant, son of the blacksmith, dressed in his American coat, and the venerable Nazaire Larouche, who remains in his everyday garb. The community is tightly knit, with weekly gatherings offering a rare chance for social interaction in this harsh, isolated land.

Maria Chapdelaine, recently returned from a visit to St. Prime, is a focal point of interest. Her father, Samuel Chapdelaine, farms a plot of land across the river, a challenging existence in the encroaching wilderness. François Paradis, a young man with a rugged past, expresses his intention to visit the Chapdelaines. He is known for his adventurous spirit, having sold his farm to pursue a life in the woods, trapping and trading with the Indians.

As spring arrives, the Chapdelaines and their hired man, Edwige Legare, set to work clearing land, a laborious task that involves felling trees and uprooting stumps. The family is self-reliant, with Maria and her mother managing the household and livestock. Despite the harsh conditions, there is a sense of satisfaction in their toil, as they transform the forest into arable land.

François Paradis visits the Chapdelaines, rekindling a connection with Maria. They share a moment in the woods, picking blueberries, where François promises to return in the spring, having given up drinking and swearing. Maria is filled with hope and dreams of their future together.

As the seasons change, the Chapdelaines face the challenges of the harsh Canadian climate. A severe drought affects the crops, and the family works tirelessly to bring in the harvest before the early frosts. The onset of winter brings a shift in routine, with the family preparing for the long months ahead, ensuring they have enough wood and provisions.

Maria, longing to attend midnight mass on Christmas Eve, is thwarted by impassable roads. Instead, she undertakes the spiritual task of reciting a thousand Aves, seeking divine favor for François's safe return. Her devotion is intertwined with the rhythms of rural life, where faith and daily toil are inseparable.

Throughout the narrative, the characters are portrayed with a deep connection to their land and community. The Chapdelaines embody the resilience and endurance required to thrive in such an unforgiving environment. Maria's inner life is rich with dreams and aspirations, shaped by the rugged beauty of her surroundings and her steadfast hope for the future with François.

As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the land and its challenges are as much a part of the characters' lives as their personal relationships. The narrative captures the essence of life in the remote Canadian wilderness, where love, faith, and hard work are inextricably linked. Maria's journey is one of self-discovery and acceptance, as she learns to navigate the complexities of love and the demands of her environment.
