The story begins in the quaint village of Moonfleet, nestled half a mile from the sea on the west bank of the Fleet stream. The village, once under the dominion of the great Mohune family, is now a shadow of its former self, with its population dwindling and its buildings in decay. The protagonist, John Trenchard, a fifteen-year-old orphan living with his strict aunt, Miss Arnold, finds himself entangled in the village's mysterious past.

John's life takes a dramatic turn on a stormy night when he stumbles upon a secret passage leading to the Mohune family vault beneath the church. The vault, rumored to be haunted by the ghost of Colonel John Mohune, also known as Blackbeard, becomes the center of John's adventures. He discovers a parchment in a locket that belonged to Blackbeard, which hints at the existence of a hidden diamond.

Elzevir Block, the landlord of the Why Not? inn, becomes a father figure to John after saving him from a near-death experience in the vault. The two form a close bond, and John moves in with Elzevir after being turned away by his aunt. Elzevir, a former smuggler, is entangled in the village's illicit trade, which becomes another thread in John's life.

The village is rife with tension due to the efforts of the local magistrate, Mr. Maskew, who is determined to put an end to smuggling. Maskew's daughter, Grace, becomes a significant figure in John's life, as they develop a secret friendship despite their fathers' enmity. Maskew's determination to enforce the law leads to a series of confrontations with Elzevir and the smugglers.

As the story unfolds, John and Elzevir find themselves on the run after a tragic incident involving Maskew. Their journey takes them across the sea to Holland, where they attempt to sell the diamond. Their plans are thwarted by deception, leading to their capture and imprisonment. After enduring years of hardship, they manage to escape and return to Moonfleet, where they confront their past and seek redemption.

The story concludes with John inheriting a fortune from a repentant jeweler who had wronged him. He uses the wealth to rebuild the village, including the Mohune almshouses, and finds happiness with Grace. Elzevir's sacrifice and John's perseverance lead to a new beginning for Moonfleet, as the village is revitalized and its dark past laid to rest.
