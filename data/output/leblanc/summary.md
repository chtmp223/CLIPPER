The story begins with Gilberte Armand and her mother, Mme. Armand, arriving at the Villa-pension des Deux Mondes in Dieppe. They are from London, but their next destination is uncertain. Mme. Armand is fatigued from their travels, and their conversation reveals a mysterious past, especially concerning Gilberte's upbringing and her father's death. Mme. Armand hints at secrets she will reveal one day, but before any answers can be given, she dies suddenly, leaving Gilberte alone and devastated.

Gilberte, now an orphan, must navigate her future without any clear knowledge of her identity or family background. She stays at the Villa-pension and is advised by the lady of the house to seek legal assistance. Maître Dufornéril, a solicitor, is brought in to help uncover her past. He discovers that Gilberte's mother had used various aliases across Europe, and there are no existing papers to establish their true identities. Despite the mystery, Gilberte is found to be financially secure due to securities left by her mother.

Seeking solitude, Gilberte moves to Domfront, renting a manor-house called the Logis from Mme. de la Vaudraye, a local aristocrat who has fallen on hard times. Gilberte poses as a widow, hoping to avoid unwanted attention. She becomes known as "la Bonne Demoiselle" for her charitable deeds among the local poor. However, her beauty and wealth attract several suitors, including M. Beaufrelant, M. le Hourteulx, and young Simare, leading to unwanted advances and complications.

Gilberte finds solace in the daily routine of visiting a ruined summer-house, where she senses the presence of a mysterious figure watching her from afar. This figure is revealed to be Guillaume de la Vaudraye, Mme. de la Vaudraye's son, who has been captivated by Gilberte since her arrival. Despite his initial coldness and the social barriers between them, a friendship and mutual affection develop.

Their relationship faces challenges, particularly from Mme. de la Vaudraye, who is concerned about the social implications of her son's interest in Gilberte, especially given Gilberte's unknown background. Despite this, Guillaume and Gilberte's bond strengthens, culminating in a declaration of love. However, Guillaume's financial insecurity and Gilberte's mysterious past present obstacles to their union.

Guillaume, overwhelmed by his love for Gilberte and the societal pressures, decides to leave Domfront, believing it is the honorable course of action. He writes a heartfelt letter to Gilberte, explaining his departure. Mme. de la Vaudraye, upon learning of her son's feelings and Gilberte's wealth, urges Gilberte to write to Guillaume and bring him back. However, Gilberte insists that Guillaume must resolve his internal conflict independently.

Eventually, Guillaume returns, unable to stay away, and they reaffirm their love and commitment to each other. Gilberte reveals to Guillaume that she is not a widow, but an unmarried girl who had adopted the guise of a widow for protection. This revelation delights Guillaume, as it aligns with his ideals of love and purity.

Despite their love, Mme. de la Vaudraye remains an obstacle, insisting on knowing Gilberte's true identity before consenting to the marriage. Gilberte, determined to marry with Mme. de la Vaudraye's approval, agrees to wait, demonstrating her integrity and devotion to Guillaume.

The story concludes with Gilberte alone, reflecting on the challenges she faces, yet hopeful for the future, as she remains steadfast in her love for Guillaume and her resolve to uncover her true identity.
