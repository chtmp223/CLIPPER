CHAPTER XIV

The Villa Bleue


Delia's good resolution remained only half fulfilled, for after all she visited Count Sutri's cove again. This time, however, it was in a perfectly orthodox fashion. Mr. and Mrs. Bond, meeting Miss Morley at the house of an American resident in Fossato, invited the whole school to come and view the garden on Sunday afternoon, and clad in their best dresses the girls paraded in through the gate, and were shown the beauties of the lovely grounds. They were taken in relays down in the lift to the creek by the sea, and afterwards entertained with ice-cream and biscuits on the terrace in front of the villa, which was all very interesting and delightful, though not nearly so exciting as the surreptitious peep which the naughty trio had previously obtained on their own account. Mr. Bond might indeed be silent on the subject of that afternoon's adventure, but the expedition into his grounds had been only a part of Peachy's pranks in her game of "Follow the Leader," and for one of her sins at any rate she was to be called to account. The cistern on the top of the roof supplied a tap on the upper landing from which Anastasia, one of the chambermaids, was accustomed to draw water with which to fill the bedroom jugs.

On the morning after the events just narrated she took her can as usual, but was utterly horrified, when she turned the tap, to find the water running red. She was intensely superstitious, and immediately jumped to the conclusion that she was the victim of witchcraft, so she flung her apron over her head, commenced to sob, and deplored the early death which would probably overtake her. She sat on the landing making quite a scene, prophesying evil to the other servants who crowded round to condole and marvel, and showing the bewitched water in her jug with a mixture of importance and horror. The girls who occupied rooms on the upper landing were duly thrilled, and, after debating every possible or impossible solution of the mystery, were on the point of carrying the tale to Miss Rodgers when Peachy came hurrying along.

"I've only just heard. Don't, _don't_ go to the 'Ogre's Den' about it. If you love me don't. I guess I know what's happened. The water's _not_ bewitched. If you've any sense left in your silly head come with me on to the roof and we'll look at the cistern. We'll soon find out what's the matter. Callie, lend me your butterfly-net, that's a saintly girl!"

Anastasia, though somewhat protesting, allowed herself to be persuaded, and went with Peachy first to the kitchen floor and then up the iron staircase to the roof. Approaching the cistern Peachy climbed on to its edge, lowered her butterfly-net, and presently fished up a wet and draggled scarlet ribbon which stained her fingers red as she held it out to Anastasia's astonished gaze.

"I guess it's this that has been bleeding inside the tank and has stained the water," she explained.

"But, Signorina, I ask how it place itself there?" demanded the still puzzled chambermaid in her halting English, then mother-wit overmastering native superstition, she burst into laughter. "Oh! Oh! Oh! It is no magic but you, Signorina. Who hid my towels? I go to tell Mees Rodgers. Yes! You shall get into very big scrape!"

"No, Anastasia, don't tell," implored Peachy. "It was only a joke. Look here! Are you fond of chocolates? I had a box sent me yesterday, and you shall have them all. It won't do any good to tell Miss Rodgers, will it?"

"You not come on to this roof again and touch my towels?" conceded Anastasia doubtfully.

"Never! I promise faithfully."

"Then I not tell."

"Good! You're a white angel. I'll square the girls and get them not to mind washing in pink water for a day or two. It ought to improve their complexions. So we'll just say nothing at all about it at headquarters. That's settled. Anastasia, your English is improving wonderfully; I guess I'll teach you some American next--it's the finest language in the world. Botheration, I've soused Callie's butterfly-net. I don't know what she'll say about it. I'm out of one scrape into another the whole time. Well, I'd rather face Callie than Miss Rodgers anyhow. She may storm, but she can't give me bad marks or stop my next exeat. Come along, Anastasia. We'll take the ribbon with us to show as a trophy. It will give them a little bit of a surprise downstairs if I'm not mistaken."

Owing to luck, and to the kindness of Anastasia, Peachy's pranks did not on this occasion meet with any punishment. Irene, who had been greatly fearing an exposure of the whole escapade, once more breathed freely. If the matter had come to the ears of Miss Rodgers the three girls would certainly have been "gated," and Irene was particularly anxious not to lose her approaching exeat. It was her turn to go to tea at the Villa Bleue, and she was looking forward greatly to the occasion. It would be her first visit, for she had forfeited her privilege earlier in the term, when she and Lorna lost themselves among the olive groves. Much to their satisfaction the buddies were invited together, in company with Mary, Sheila, Monica, and Winnie, who were also on the good conduct list. Of course there was considerable prinking in front of the looking-glasses, careful adjusting of hair ribbons and other trifles of toilet, before the girls considered themselves in party trim and ready to do credit to the Villa Camellia. Escorted by Miss Brewster, who acted chaperon, or "policewoman" as Sheila insisted on calling her, they walked in orderly file down the eucalyptus avenue to the town, past the hotel, along the esplanade, and up a steep incline to the Villa Bleue. The hospitable little parsonage seemed an exact materialization of the personality of its owners. Canon and Mrs. Clark were both small and smiling and charitable and particularly kind, and their tiny unpretentious dwelling, with its sunny aspect and its flowers and its pet birds, was absolutely in keeping with their tone of mind. From some houses seem to emanate certain mental atmospheres, as if they reflected the sum total of the thoughts that have collected there, and sensitive visitors receive subconscious impressions of chilly magnificence, intellectual activity or a spirit of general tolerance.

The Villa Bleue always felt radiant with kind and cheery impulses, and its flower-covered walls seemed almost to shine as the girls, secure of a welcome, parted from Miss Brewster, and ran up the steps to the pleasant veranda. Mrs. Clark made them at home at once. She had six cosy basket-chairs waiting for them, and a plateful of most delicious almond taffy, and she installed them to sit and admire the view, while she talked and put them at their ease. Schoolgirls are notoriously bashful visitors, and in certain circumstances all six would have been mum as mice and entirely devoid of conversation except a conventional yes or no, but with dear Mrs. Clark's beaming face and warm-hearted manner to disarm their shyness they were perfectly natural, and enjoyed themselves as entirely as if they were at a dormitory tea or a sorority supper. The best part about Mrs. Clark was that she had the happy knack of forgetting her age and throwing herself back into the mental environment of sixteen. She was certainly not a stiff hostess; indeed her treatment of her guests was less conventional than that adopted by Rachel Moseley at the prefects' parties; she laughed and chatted and asked questions about the school, till in a few minutes the girls were chattering like sparrows and behaving as if they had known her for years.

Tea was set out on little basket tables in the veranda, and there were all the delicious home-made things for which the Villa Bleue had gained a just reputation--brown scones and honey, potato cakes, Scotch shortbread, buttered oatmeal biscuits, iced lemon sandwich cake, and chocolate fingers.

When tea was taken away and the basket tables were once more free, Mrs. Clark produced dainty cards and scarlet pencils and organized a competition. It was entitled "Nursery Rhymes," and contained twenty questions to be answered by the competitors. These ran as follows:


NURSERY RHYMES COMPETITION

          1. Who made Cock Robin's shroud?

          2. Who was exhausted by family cares?

          3. Who disliked insects?

          4. Who showed an interest in           horticulture?

          5. Who summoned an orchestra?

          6. Who pursued matrimonial intentions           without the parental sanction?

          7. Who showed religious intolerance?

          8. Who took a joint that did not belong           to him?

          9. Who deplored the loss of hand gear?

          10. Whose salary was restricted owing to           slackness in work?

          11. What animal pursued horological           investigations?

          12. Who made the record high jump?

          13. Who wore a superfluity of jewelry?

          14. Whose culinary efforts were           temporarily confiscated?

          15. Who pulled Pussy from the well?

          16. Who slept instead of attending to           business?

          17. Who exhibited sanctimonious           satisfaction over a meal?

          19. Who had an accident during the           performance of their duty?

          20. Who was mutilated by a bird?

Some of the questions seemed easy and some were difficult. The girls sat puzzling over them, and writing the answers when they got inspiration. Irene scribbled away delightedly, but Lorna, who had almost forgotten the nursery rhymes of her childhood, was in much mystification, and only filled in a few of the vacant spaces. Numbers 6, 7, 13 and 14 proved the most baffling and no one was able to solve all twenty.

After allowing a considerable laxity in respect of time Mrs. Clark rang the bell and declared the competition closed. The girls changed cards, and waited with interest while their hostess read out the answers.


ANSWERS TO NURSERY RHYMES COMPETITION

          1. I, said the beetle,              With my thread and needle.

There I met an old man              Who wouldn't say his prayers,              So I took him by the left leg              And threw him down the stairs.

          18. Little Bo Peep.

          19. Jack and Jill.

          20. The maid was in the garden               Hanging out the clothes,               When by came a blackbird               And nipped off her nose.

There was a good deal of laughter over the competition and much counting up of marks. Irene, who had scored eighteen out of the possible twenty, came out top, and was accordingly handed the pretty little photograph frame which formed the prize.

"I only got six," mourned Lorna. "I was a perfect duffer at it."

"I had fifteen," purred Sheila, "but I couldn't for the life of me remember who made Cock Robin's shroud, or who pulled Pussy out of the well."

"It's such ages since I read any nursery rhymes," said Monica.

"That's just the fun of it, of course!" declared Mary. "Did you make up the questions, Mrs. Clark?"

"No, I got the Canon to compose them. He'll be glad you liked them. Oh, here he comes. He had to go to a committee meeting this afternoon. Did you get tea, dear, at Major Littleton's?" (to her husband). "That's right! Then sit down on this comfy chair and entertain us, please."

"Rather a big order," laughed Canon Clark, shaking hands with his young visitors, and taking the proffered seat. "How do you want to be entertained? No sermons to-day?" and his eyes twinkled. "Don't all speak at once. I'm beginning to get nervous!"

"You can tell the most beautiful stories," suggested Sheila, who had paid visits before to the Villa Bleue and knew the capabilities of her host.

"Oh, yes, please, _do_ tell us a story!" agreed the others. "We'd like it better than anything."

"I have one inside my desk which is just ready to send off to a magazine. If it won't bore you to listen to it, I'll read it aloud and let you judge whether it has any interest in it or not. An audience of schoolgirls ought to be severe critics. As a rule they're omnivorous readers of fiction. If you turn it down I shall tear it up."

"Oh, but we shan't!"

"_Please_ begin!"

Thus urged, Canon Clark fetched a manuscript from his study, and after passing round the plate of taffy, to "sweeten his narrative" as he put it, he sat down in his basket-chair on the veranda and began to read.


"THE LUCK OF DACREPOOL

         "I had known Jack Musgrave out East; we had chummed          at Mandalay, messed together at Singapore, hunted          big game up in Kashmir, and shot tigers in Bengal,          and, when we said good-by, as he boarded the          homeward-bound steamer at Madras, it was with a          cordial invitation on his part that I should look          him up if ever I happened to penetrate into the          remote corner of Cumberland where his family acres          were situated.

         "For a year or two my affairs kept me in India, and          nothing seemed more unlikely than that--for the          present, at any rate--Jack and I should cross paths          again, but by one of those strange chances which          sometimes occur in this world I found myself, on          the Christmas Eve of 190-, standing on the platform          of Holdergate Station, having missed the connection          for Scotland, and with the pleasing prospect before          me of spending the night, and possibly--if trains          were not available--the ensuing Christmas Day at          the one very second-rate inn in the village.

         "It was then that I remembered that Holdergate was          the nearest station to Dacrepool Grange, and that,          if Jack's memory still held good, I might find a          hearty welcome and spend a pleasant evening          recalling old times and discussing past shots,          instead of putting up with the inferior          accommodation offered by the landlady of the King's          Arms. As no one either at the station or in the          village seemed willing to vouchsafe me definite          information as to whether the owner of Dacrepool          was at home or abroad, parrying my inquiries with          such scant courtesy and in so uncouth and          unintelligible a dialect as to be scarce          understood, I resolved to chance it, and with some          difficulty hiring a farmer's gig, I started out on          a six-mile drive over the bleak moorlands, which          seemed to stretch as far as the eye could reach in          a dim vista of brown heath and distant snow-clad          fell. It was a dreary and unseasonable evening,          with a damp mist rising from the sodden ground, and          occasional falls of sleet, mingled with rain that          chilled one to the bone. I buttoned my coat closely          round my throat, and braced my nerves to meet the          elements, hoping I might find my reward at the end          of my journey, and inwardly cursing every mile of          the rough road.

         "But even Cumberland miles cannot wind on forever,          and my Jehu at length drew up at a massive stone          gateway, which he assured me formed the entrance to          Dacrepool Grange. There was neither light nor sound          in the lodge, nor did any one come out in answer to          our impatient calls, so we had perforce to open the          gates for ourselves. They creaked on their rusty          hinges, as if they had not been unclosed for many a          day, and when I noted the neglected drive, where          the overhanging trees swept our faces as we passed,          I began to fear that I had come on a fool's errand,          and that I should find the house shut up and my          friend abroad.

         "On this point, however, my driver reassured me.          'Nay, oo'be to home, theer's a light i' yon          winder,' he said, pointing with his whip where a          faint streak of yellow shone like a beacon into the          surrounding gloom. The moon was struggling through          the clouds, and I could dimly discern the outline          of the quaint gabled front of the house, with its          mullioned windows, and masses of clinging ivy.          Dismounting at the old stone porch, I seized the          knocker and beat a mighty tattoo. There was no          reply. Even the light had disappeared from the          window almost simultaneously with the approach of          our carriage wheels, and though I hammered for          fully five minutes I failed to obtain the slightest          response to my knocks. I was on the point of          turning away in despair and driving back in the gig          to Holdergate, when a sound of footsteps was heard          within, together with an unbolting and unbarring,          the door was opened about six inches on the chain,          and a hard-featured woman peeped cautiously out          into the darkness.

         "I at once proclaimed my identity and my errand,          but, by the light of the candle which she held in          her hand, she looked me up and down with a glance          of keen distrust and evident disfavor. 'How am I to          know it is as you say?' she replied guardedly, and          without making any move to grant me admittance.

         "'Then fetch your master,' I exclaimed with some          heat, thrusting my card into her hand. 'He should          know my name at any rate, though he seems to have          trained you in strange notions of hospitality to          keep a guest standing on the doorstep on a bitter          evening in December.'

         "Grumbling under her breath she went away, and I          was half inclined to follow her example and quit          this very unpromising spot, when a quick step          resounded in the hall, the door was flung open          wide, and I was dragged forcibly into the house by          my friend Jack, who hailed me with such unfeigned          delight and enthusiasm that there could be little          doubt of the genuineness of his welcome.

         "'You've sprung upon us at a queer time, as it          happens, old man, but if you don't mind taking          pot-luck we'll spend a ripping night together,' he          cried, hauling me into the dining-room, where a          pretty fairy of a girl sprang up to greet us. 'This          is my sister Bessie, and I've talked about you so          often that she'll give you as big a welcome as I          do. It's only a poor best we can show you in the          way of entertainment, but you'll make allowances          when I tell you how I'm situated, and what we lack          in kind we must make up in good will.'

         "'What's good enough for you will be good enough          for me,' I replied heartily, submitting to be          relieved of my coat and installed in the best chair          by the blazing fire--a pleasant change indeed from          the cold and the sleet outside.

         "'You must not think our guests usually receive          such a churlish reception,' said Jack, laughing a          little, 'but the fact is, we took you for the          bailiffs. I'm sorry to say I've outrun the          constable--it's really not my fault, for the old          place was mortgaged to its last penny when it fell          to me--but, as the case stands, I'm enduring a kind          of siege; daren't put my nose out of my own door          for fear I should be served with writs, and have to          smuggle what supplies we can beg or borrow through          the kitchen window. It's a queer kind of Christmas          to spend, and a poor lookout for the New Year, for          I'm afraid the old place is bound to go in the end,          though I have vowed to stick to it as long as I can          hold it, and Bessie has vowed to stick to me,          though she might have a more cheerful home          elsewhere if she liked. There's precious little to          offer you in our larder, but perhaps we can furnish          up something in the way of supper; can't we,          Bessie?'

         "Miss Musgrave laughed merrily.

         "'Mr. Harper must imagine himself back in camp,'          she replied; 'I hope he can manage to subsist on          porridge and cheese and tinned provisions, for I          don't think we have anything better to offer him.'

         "I would have subsisted on a far poorer diet to          remain within sight of those bright eyes, and I          endeavored to convince my host and hostess that I          desired nothing more than to be treated as one of          themselves, with such success that I seemed to drop          at once into the family circle, and never spent a          pleasanter or more jovial evening in my life. Jack          and I sat up late after Bessie had retired,          chatting of bygone days and past adventures till          the jungles and plains seemed almost more real than          the cheery blaze of the fire before us; but the          talk came round at last to the affairs of the          moment.

         "'Is not there any plan by which you could raise          the wind, Jack?'" I inquired.

         "'Never a one. I've tried every end up, but there          seems no way out of the trouble unless, indeed, we          could find Sir Godfrey's treasure.'

         "'Who's he?'

         "'An ancestor of mine, rather a back number,          considering he died somewhere about two hundred and          fifty years ago--but a restless old gentleman, for          he is still said to have a trick of haunting the          house, and, according to popular tradition, hoping          to be able to point out the hiding-place of a          treasure he stowed away.'

         "'Was it genuine treasure?'

         "'I believe so. He went off to fight in the Civil          Wars, and hid the family plate and jewels in a          secure place which nobody knew of but himself. He          had not the sense to leave any record of the spot,          and when he was killed at Naseby his secret died          with him, and the valuables--unless, as I sometimes          suspect, the old chap had previously pledged          them--were not forthcoming, nor have they ever been          heard of since.'

         "'Has he ever appeared to you?'

         "'Not he; I only wish he would. The hoard would be          a jolly windfall to me if I could manage to light          upon it. But I'm not the kind who goes about seeing          ghosts. I'm too plain and matter-of-fact by half,          and, though I often hear mysterious taps on the          panels of my bedroom, I prosaically set it down to          rats and mice. Now, you're a psychic sort of a          fellow, the seventh son of a seventh son; if he          wants to make himself visible, perhaps you may get          a sight of him; I'm afraid it's more than ever I          shall.'

         "'Is there no clew at all left as to the          hiding-place of the treasure?' I inquired.

         "'Only an old rhyme so obscure as to be quite          unintelligible:

              He who plucks a rose at Yule               Will bring back luck to Dacrepool.

         Even you, with your fondness for antiquities and          rummaging strange things out of old books, can          scarcely make anything of that, I should say.'

         "I shook my head, for the riddle seemed quite          unreadable, and as we had already sat up until long          past midnight I begged for my candle, and proposed          to defer our conversation until the morning. Jack,          declaring that none of the beds in the damp old          house was fit to sleep in without a week of          previous airing, insisted upon giving up his room          to me, and passing the night himself on the          dining-room sofa, and, in spite of my          protestations, I was forced to acquiesce in his          plans for my comfort.

         "Left alone, I looked with some curiosity round the          gloomy oak-paneled chamber, where the fire-light          flashed on the carved four-poster, with its faded          yellow damask curtains, and lit up the moth-eaten          tapestry that adorned a portion of the upper part          of the walls, but scarcely illumined the dark          corners which lay beyond. There were quaint old          presses and chests roomy enough to hide a dozen          ghosts in, and a portrait of a gentleman in the          elaborate costume of the Stuart period seemed to          look down upon me with strangely haunting eyes.

         "'A spooky enough place,' I murmured, 'hallowed by          the spirits of numerous generations, no doubt.          Well, I'll undertake they won't disturb me          to-night, for I am dog-tired and mean to sleep like          a log.'

         "I am an old traveler, and was soon in bed and          enjoying a well-earned slumber, but my dreams were          wild, for I seemed now to be driving furiously over          the moorland, pursuing ever the phantom of pretty          Bessie, who, with her bewitching smile, was luring          me into the fog and darkness, and now to be barring          the front door to defend her from some unknown          assailant, whose perpetual rapping rang like an          echo through my brain. With the impotent strength          of dreamland I struggled vainly to close the door,          which was opening slowly to admit the nameless          horror. I seemed to feel a hot breath on my cheek,          and with a wild shriek I woke, to find the          moonlight streaming in through the broad          diamond-paned window, falling in a white shaft          across the floor, while the last embers of the fire          were smoldering to ashes upon the hearth.

         "I sat up in bed with that feeling of broad          awakeness and alertness which comes to us          sometimes, and caught my breath as I listened, for          through the stillness of the night came the          unmistakable sound of a gentle tapping from behind          the paneling of the wall. It was not continuous,          but more as one might rap at the chamber door of a          sleeping person, waiting every now and then to hear          if one had obtained a response. An intense and          vivid sensation came over me that I was not alone          in the room; that there was some presence other          than my own personality which was striving in some          way to force itself upon my consciousness and          arrest my attention. Was it only my fancy, or were          the moonbeams actually shaping themselves into a          human form, till against the dark background of the          fireplace, I seemed to see the misty shadowy          outline of a figure, so vague and ethereal that          even as I looked it appeared to melt again into the          moonlight and cease to exist?

         "With every nerve on the stretch I strained my          eyes to gain a clearer impression. A passing cloud          left the room for a few moments in darkness, but,          as the beams shone out full and clear once more,          that shadowy figure seemed to gather substance, and          I felt as if some unknown force were compelling my          attention and chaining my every sense in a mute          endeavor to establish some chord of connection          between me and the dim spirit world which floats          forever round us. Now waxing, now waning, the          vision grew, till I fancied I caught a glint of          armor. For an instant a wild imploring glance met          my own, and a transparent finger pointed to the          richly-carved paneling below the arras, but as I          sprang from the bed the vision faded swiftly away,          leaving me standing on the floor in the calm          moonlight doubting the evidence of my senses, and          half convinced that I must still have been in the          continuance of my dream.

         "Yet, as I looked, something in the carved paneling          struck my notice, and, following the direction in          which the spectral finger had pointed, I saw that          the dragons and the twisted scrolls were united in          the center by a Tudor rose. In an instant there          flashed across my mind the old saying which Jack          had quoted:

              He who plucks a rose at Yule               Will bring back luck to Dacrepool.

         What impulse urged me I cannot say, but compelled          by some seemingly irresistible suggestion I seized          the sculptured rose and wrenched at it with all my          strength. There was a dull thud, followed by a          harsh grinding noise, and the whole of the paneling          slid slowly back, revealing a cavity behind, where,          half hidden by the accumulations of dust and          cobwebs, I could catch a sight of silver tankards          and masses of plate enough to make the mouth of a          collector water with envy. Still scarcely certain          whether I was sleeping or waking, I put in my hand          and drew out a bag filled with something heavy, and          even as I did so the rotten mildewed canvas broke          with the strain, and a stream of golden coins          descended with a clatter upon the floor.

         "Like a maniac I rushed to my door and hallooed          lustily for Jack, who, roused by my shouts, came          hurrying up in scanty attire, with a revolver in          one hand and a poker in the other.

         "'What is it, old man, thieves or bailiffs? Just          hold 'em till I come, can't you?'

         "'It's neither,' I replied, as I hauled him in with          triumph, 'but I believe I have had a visit from          your esteemed ancestor, and, as a Christmas gift,          allow me to introduce you to the long-lost family          treasure.'

         "There was no mistake about it--it was real enough,          and, as the Christmas bells came chiming through          the frosty air, we turned out bags of gold, piles          of silver and priceless jewels warranted to redeem          Dacrepool Grange twice over if necessary, and          sending Jack into a very ecstasy of joy.

         "'By Jove, old chap,' he exclaimed, 'I owe it all          to you. Here I've slept in this room for years, and          never paid any heed to the raps and taps, though          I've heard them often enough, while the treasure          was under my very nose, only waiting to be          discovered. Then you come along with your          ghost-seeing eyes, and the spirit, if spirit it          was, is able to convey to you the secret it's been          trying to get off its mind for hundreds of years.          You've saved me from the bankruptcy court, and it's          a debt of gratitude you'll find I shan't lightly          forget.'

         "It was a very jovial Christmas which we spent          that day, for the news of the find got abroad at          daylight, and we were promptly visited by the          butcher and baker, bringing stores of good cheer          and profuse apologies for past misunderstandings;          even the severe old servant relapsed into smiles as          she bore in a smoking sirloin of beef. Jack's          spirits rose to the wildest pitch, and little          Bessie, who persisted in calling me the savior of          the family credit, could scarcely do enough to show          her gratitude. Jack wanted me to share the best of          the jewels with him, and was so annoyed at my          refusal that I could only gain peace by a hint that          I should sometime ask him for something more          valuable still. And I got my way, for my unexpected          visit lengthened out to a stay of some weeks,          during which pretty Bessie's gratitude had time to          ripen into a warmer feeling. So in the end it was          quite a different treasure which I bore away from          Dacrepool Grange, and I feel equally with Jack that          I have cause to remember that strange Christmas          Eve, and to render my thanks to old Sir Godfrey,          who now sleeps soundly in his grave, secure in the          accomplishment of his mission, having rid his soul          of the burden of his secret and restored luck to          Dacrepool."

"Is it true?" asked Sheila, as Canon Clark folded up his manuscript.

"Well, I can hardly call it a personal reminiscence, but you must allow for author's license. Old historic houses sometimes have secret hiding-places, and dreams are undoubtedly strange things. It's all founded upon legends which I have heard. Mrs. Clark and I first met in an ancient grange not at all unlike Dacrepool, didn't we, Bess? And if we didn't find treasure behind the paneling we certainly ought to have done so. Now I'm extremely sorry to have to hurry you, but I promised Miss Morley that you should be back at school by half past six, and I undertook to escort you through the town. I hope you'll all come and have tea with us some afternoon next term and we'll have another competition. Don't say good-by to Mrs. Clark. Give the Italian 'A rivederci' instead, because that means not a parting greeting but 'May we see one another again.'"
