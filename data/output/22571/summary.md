Escaping from jail with the help of Black Harry's gang, who mistake him for their leader, Frank finds himself amidst the outlaws. He learns that Black Harry has a double, and he uses this to his advantage to gather information about the gang's plans. In a daring escape, Frank manages to save Lona Dawson, a girl who had been kidnapped by Black Harry, and they both survive a fall into a river.
