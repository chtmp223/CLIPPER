In the early summer on the banks of the Thames, the Bligh family is in turmoil as they receive a letter from Alfred Bligh, the eldest son, who was thought to be in Australia. The letter reveals that he is on his way back to England with an Australian wife, Gladys, whom the family has never heard of before. Sir James and Lady Bligh, along with their son Granville, react with a mix of shock and concern about the sudden news and the implications of Alfred's impulsive marriage.

Lady Bligh tries to remain optimistic, noting Alfred's age and the inevitability of his settling down, but is worried about the abruptness and the unknown nature of Gladys. Granville reads the letter aloud, providing a sarcastic commentary on Alfred's writing style and sentiments. Despite the initial alarm, the family prepares to welcome Gladys, hoping for the best.

When Alfred and Gladys arrive, the family is struck by Gladys's beauty but also by her distinct Australian mannerisms and speech, which are foreign and sometimes jarring to the Blighs. Alfred is deeply in love and blind to any potential issues, while Gladys is enthusiastic but unaware of the cultural differences that make her stand out.

Granville, the clever but somewhat cynical younger son, finds amusement in Gladys's unrefined ways and often makes her the subject of his wit. Despite this, Gladys tries to adapt to her new life and win over her in-laws. She struggles with the social expectations and norms of English society, which are very different from her life in the Australian bush.

The family dynamics are further complicated by an incident in Hyde Park, where Gladys, in a moment of excitement, calls out to a friend with a loud "coo-ee," causing a public scene. This embarrasses the Blighs and highlights the cultural gap between Gladys and her new family. Alfred is caught between his love for Gladys and his family's expectations, while Gladys feels increasingly isolated and misunderstood.

Lady Bligh, a kind and charitable woman, eventually reaches out to Gladys, and they have a heartfelt conversation. Gladys expresses her desire to fit in and improve herself, acknowledging her shortcomings but also her determination to change. Lady Bligh promises to help her, and they begin to form a bond.

As Gladys makes efforts to adapt and learn, Granville continues to observe and occasionally mock her, though he also becomes more sympathetic. Alfred remains supportive, and Lady Bligh grows to appreciate Gladys's genuine efforts and her love for Alfred.

The story highlights the challenges of cultural integration, the importance of empathy and understanding in family relationships, and the personal growth that comes from facing and overcoming differences. Through her determination and the support of her new family, Gladys begins to find her place in England, proving that love and perseverance can bridge even the widest cultural divides.
