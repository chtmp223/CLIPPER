   a. ""The gigantic hound footprints found near Sir Charles's body by Dr. Mortimer"": This part is grounded in event 7 of Chapter 2, where Dr. Mortimer reveals to Holmes and Watson that he found footprints of a gigantic hound near Sir Charles's body.
   b. ""The small, ordinary dog later seen pursuing Sir Henry on the moor"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline or the book summary. In Chapter 14, a monstrous, phosphorescent hound is described as pursuing Sir Henry, not a small, ordinary dog.

   a. The relationship is not valid because the claim incorrectly describes the hound pursuing Sir Henry as a ""small, ordinary dog,"" which contradicts the description of a ""monstrous, phosphorescent hound"" in Chapter 14.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the hound is consistently described as large and fearsome, not small and ordinary.

Since 1b., 2a., and 2c. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
