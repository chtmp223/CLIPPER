   a. The relationship is meaningful and valid. The claim juxtaposes two events that highlight the harsh conditions in Boyd City and the different fates of two individuals. While Dick finds shelter, another man succumbs to the cold, emphasizing the theme of survival and the precariousness of life for those in difficult circumstances.
