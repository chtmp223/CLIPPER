The story unfolds in the small town of Dawson's Landing, where the seemingly mundane lives of its residents are upended by a series of dramatic events.

Pudd'nhead Wilson, an intelligent but misunderstood lawyer, arrives in the town and sets up a modest law practice. Despite his keen intellect, a single offhand remark earns him the nickname "Pudd'nhead," and he struggles to find clients. However, Wilson occupies his time with various hobbies, including palmistry and the study of fingerprints, which he meticulously records and analyzes.

In the Driscoll household, Percy Driscoll, a prominent figure in the town, owns several slaves, including Roxy, who is only one-sixteenth black and appears white. Roxy is the mother of a child named Valet de Chambre, who grows up alongside Driscoll's own son, Tom. When Roxy learns that her son could be sold down the river, she makes a desperate decision to switch the infants, raising her son as the white heir, Tom, and the real Tom as the slave, Chambers.

As the boys grow up, Tom, raised as a privileged white child, becomes spoiled and arrogant, while Chambers, unaware of his true heritage, grows up as a humble and obedient slave. Tom's behavior worsens as he matures, indulging in gambling and accumulating debts. Meanwhile, Roxy, having been freed by Percy Driscoll, works on steamboats to secure a better future for herself.

Years later, the town is abuzz with excitement when a pair of Italian twins, Luigi and Angelo Capello, arrive. Their presence stirs the community, and they quickly become the center of attention. However, trouble brews when Judge Driscoll, Percy's brother and Tom's guardian, is found murdered. Suspicion falls on the twins, who are charged with the crime.

Pudd'nhead Wilson, who has been quietly observing the town and collecting fingerprints, takes on the task of defending the twins. Through his meticulous records, Wilson discovers that the fingerprints on the murder weapon do not match those of the twins but instead match those of Tom Driscoll. The revelation exposes the truth about the switched identities, shocking the town and changing the lives of those involved.

The real Tom Driscoll, now revealed to be Chambers, is restored to his rightful position, while the false Tom, now known as Valet de Chambre, faces the consequences of his actions. The twins are exonerated, and Wilson gains the recognition he deserves for his brilliance and dedication to justice.

In the end, the story reflects on themes of identity, race, and the impact of nature versus nurture, as well as the power of justice and truth in overcoming societal prejudices.
