In the opening chapters of the story, set during an unusually hot June, the narrator, a lawyer, is weary from a series of trying days in court, particularly due to the Minturn case. His friend Jim Godfrey, a police reporter for the Record, invites him to spend a restful weekend at a summer place Godfrey has leased on the far edge of the Bronx. Godfrey hints at interesting phenomena in the neighborhood that might capture the lawyer's interest, which piques his curiosity.

Upon arriving at Godfrey's place, the lawyer is introduced to the mystery involving their neighbor, Worthington Vaughan, a reclusive and wealthy man with an interest in the supernatural. Vaughan lives with his daughter, Marjorie, and is under the influence of a mysterious yogi named Francisco Silva. Godfrey and the lawyer witness a strange, star-like light descending from the sky at midnight, which seems to be connected to Vaughan's peculiar rituals.

The lawyer learns more about Vaughan from Godfrey, who explains that Vaughan is a student of mysticism and has become a convert to Silva's teachings. Vaughan's daughter, Marjorie, is also involved, and there are implications that Silva is exerting a powerful influence over both father and daughter. Godfrey suspects that the midnight light is part of a deliberate trick to impress or manipulate Vaughan.

The plot thickens when the lawyer finds a letter addressed to Frederic Swain, a young man who had once been engaged to Marjorie Vaughan. Swain, now working as a clerk in the lawyer's office after his family's financial downfall, is summoned to the Bronx. The letter from Marjorie is a cry for help, urging Swain to meet her at an arbour in her father's grounds at night.

Swain confides in the lawyer about his engagement to Marjorie and his belief that her father is mad. Swain is determined to meet Marjorie and understand her predicament, despite the potential danger and the fact that her father has forbidden their relationship. The lawyer agrees to help Swain but insists on caution and promises to assist in finding a safe place for Marjorie if necessary.

As the night unfolds, Swain crosses into Vaughan's estate to meet Marjorie, but a scream pierces the night, prompting Godfrey and the lawyer to follow him over the wall. They discover Marjorie unconscious and her father dead, strangled in his chair. The house is eerily silent, with no servants in sight, and the only other occupant appears to be Silva, who is found in a trance-like state in a room filled with the scent of heavy perfume and a glowing crystal sphere.

The narrative introduces a complex web of mysticism, murder, and manipulation, with Swain caught in the middle, suspected of murder due to circumstantial evidence, including blood-stained finger-prints on Vaughan's robe that match his own. The lawyer and Godfrey must unravel the mystery, clear Swain's name, and protect Marjorie from the sinister influence surrounding her. As they delve deeper, they uncover Silva's plot to manipulate Vaughan and his daughter, using his knowledge of mysticism and hypnosis to control them.

The story is a blend of mystery and the supernatural, set against the backdrop of early 20th-century New York, exploring themes of power, influence, and the struggle between rationality and belief.
