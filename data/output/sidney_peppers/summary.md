Polly Pepper, a music teacher, finds herself at the center of various personal and professional challenges. When Amy Loughead, a student who neglected her practice, seeks Polly's help to impress her brother Jack, Polly sacrifices her own plans and agrees to assist Amy. This act of kindness causes friction with Pickering Dodge, who had plans with Polly to attend a concert. Polly's decision to help Amy instead of attending the concert with Pickering leads to a misunderstanding, but eventually, Pickering shows understanding and supports Polly's decision.

Meanwhile, Polly's family dynamics are also highlighted. Old Mr. King, Polly's grandfather, is a prominent figure who influences many decisions in the family. Polly's relationship with her siblings, especially Jasper, is one of mutual support and affection. Jasper, who works in publishing, faces his own set of challenges, including his father's disapproval of his career choice. Despite this, Jasper is passionate about his work and is supported by Polly.

The family also deals with the emotional turmoil following an accident involving their relative, Mrs. Whitney. Polly and Mr. King rush to her side, leaving the rest of the family to manage their affairs. During this time, Polly's influence on her students and friends becomes apparent, as they rally around her and express their admiration and support.

Amidst these events, Polly is preparing for her Recital, a significant event showcasing her students' musical talents. However, she faces a dilemma when Charlotte Chatterton, a talented but aloof girl, is invited to sing at the Recital. This decision causes tension among Polly's friends, particularly Alexia Rhys, who feels that Charlotte's participation might overshadow Polly's efforts. Despite the friction, Polly remains committed to supporting Charlotte, recognizing her talent and potential.

As the Recital approaches, Polly is faced with unexpected challenges, including a student's inability to perform due to illness. Polly steps in to fill the gap, demonstrating her dedication and resilience. The event is a success, with Charlotte's performance receiving high praise, though it leaves Polly with mixed feelings.

Throughout these events, themes of friendship, family loyalty, and personal growth are explored. Polly's selflessness and dedication to her family and students highlight her character's strength, while the various interpersonal conflicts and resolutions emphasize the importance of understanding and support in relationships. The narrative weaves together the complexities of personal ambitions, familial expectations, and the pursuit of one's passions, all centered around Polly's journey as a music teacher and beloved family member.
