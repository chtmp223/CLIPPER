   a. The relationship is not valid because the claim incorrectly states that Phoebe receives instructions from her father, which is not supported by the chapter outline.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it misattributes the source of the instructions.

Since 1b. and 2a. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
