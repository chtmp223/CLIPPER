1. On April 19th, the Weldon Institute prepares to launch their aerostat "Go-Ahead" in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park, with Harry W. Tinder as the aeronaut and Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans as passengers.
2. At 11:25 AM, the second gun is fired, and the "Go-Ahead" rises 150 feet above the clearing, held by a rope.
3. At 11:30 AM, Uncle Prudent gives the order to "Let go," and the "Go-Ahead" ascends majestically to an altitude of 800 feet.
4. The "Go-Ahead" demonstrates its maneuverability by moving horizontally, turning in circles, and moving forwards and backwards.
5. The aerostat rises to a height of 14,000 feet in search of wind, using its system of cellular balloons.
6. While stationary at this height, a moving object is spotted approaching from the northwest at high speed.
7. The crowd identifies the approaching object as the "Albatross," causing alarm and prompting the "Go-Ahead" to increase its speed eastward.

# Chapter 23
<synopsis>
The Albatross reappears, confronts the Go-Ahead in an aerial battle, and Robur ultimately saves his rivals before departing with a message about the future of aerial locomotion.
</synopsis>

<events>
1. The Albatross appears in the sky over Fairmount Park, where the Go-Ahead is in flight.
2. The Go-Ahead attempts to escape by ascending to higher altitudes, with the Albatross in pursuit.
3. At 16,000 feet, the Go-Ahead's balloon bursts due to gas expansion, causing it to fall rapidly.
4. The Albatross descends alongside the falling Go-Ahead, and Robur's crew forcibly rescues Uncle Prudent, Phil Evans, and the aeronaut.
5. The Go-Ahead crashes into trees in a clearing, while the Albatross hovers six feet above the ground.
6. Robur addresses the crowd, declaring Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans free and explaining his reasons for departing.
7. The Albatross departs towards the east, leaving the humiliated Weldon Institute members to face public sarcasm.
