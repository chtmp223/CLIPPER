The story begins with Tom Bowling, a young boy eager to join the Navy, as he embarks on his journey aboard the training ship, the _Saint Vincent_. Tom is accompanied by his friend Mick Donovan, an Irish lad with a lively personality, and they quickly become close friends. The narrative follows their experiences as they undergo various drills and training exercises, learning the ropes of seamanship and adjusting to life at sea.

Tom's father, an old sailor and now a waterman, is supportive of his son's ambitions, recalling his own experiences at sea. The story introduces a cast of characters aboard the ship, including the master-at-arms, ship's corporal, and various instructors who guide the boys through their training. Among Tom's peers is Moses Reeks, nicknamed "Ugly," who initially becomes Tom's adversary due to his surly demeanor and antagonistic behavior towards Mick.

The boys undergo rigorous training, including knotting, splicing, and learning to navigate the ship's rigging. Tom excels in these tasks, drawing on the knowledge imparted by his father. Despite some initial friction, Tom and Mick manage to navigate the challenges of training, including a memorable rat hunt aboard the ship led by the captain's dog, Gyp.

A pivotal moment occurs when Tom saves "Ugly" from a potentially fatal fall while aloft in the ship's rigging. This act of bravery earns Tom the respect of his superiors and a commendation from the captain, who acknowledges Tom's courage and potential as a sailor. Despite their previous enmity, this incident sows the seeds for a potential reconciliation between Tom and "Ugly."

As the narrative progresses, Tom and Mick are promoted to first-class boys, a testament to their hard work and dedication. They eagerly anticipate their first real sea voyage aboard the training brig _Martin_, which provides them with practical experience at sea. During this cruise, Mick suffers from seasickness, but the boys' spirits remain high as they tackle the challenges of life at sea, including an unexpected grounding of the brig on a shoal.

Throughout the story, themes of camaraderie, perseverance, and the pursuit of one's ambitions are explored. Tom's journey from a novice sailor to a competent and respected member of the ship's company highlights the transformative power of dedication and the support of friends and mentors. The narrative captures the essence of life in the Navy, with its blend of discipline, adventure, and the forging of lifelong friendships.
