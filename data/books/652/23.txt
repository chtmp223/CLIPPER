CHAPTER XXIII THE PRINCE AND HIS SISTER DIVIDE BETWEEN THEM THE WORK OF OBSERVATION.


RASSELAS returned home full of reflections, doubting how to direct his future steps.  Of the way to happiness he found the learned and simple equally ignorant; but as he was yet young, he flattered himself that he had time remaining for more experiments and further inquiries.  He communicated to Imlac his observations and his doubts, but was answered by him with new doubts and remarks that gave him no comfort.  He therefore discoursed more frequently and freely with his sister, who had yet the same hope with himself, and always assisted him to give some reason why, though he had been hitherto frustrated, he might succeed at last.

“We have hitherto,” said she, “known but little of the world; we have never yet been either great or mean.  In our own country, though we had royalty, we had no power; and in this we have not yet seen the private recesses of domestic peace.  Imlac favours not our search, lest we should in time find him mistaken.  We will divide the task between us; you shall try what is to be found in the splendour of Courts, and I will range the shades of humbler life.  Perhaps command and authority may be the supreme blessings, as they afford the most opportunities of doing good; or perhaps what this world can give may be found in the modest habitations of middle fortune—too low for great designs, and too high for penury and distress.”
