    a. ""Scott's employment and living arrangement with Ezra Little remains constant throughout the story"": This part is not grounded in the events. The chapter outlines and book summary indicate changes in Scott's employment and living situation. Initially, Scott works for Ezra Little for $3.50 a week with room and board (Chapter 6). However, by Chapter 20, Scott declines the offer to return to work at Mr. Little's store and secures a new job with Tower, Douglas & Co., indicating a change in his employment.
    b. ""Scott continuing to work at Little's store for $3.50 a week with room and board"": This part is contradicted by the chapter outline and book summary. Scott's employment at Little's store does not continue throughout the story, as he eventually finds a new job with Tower, Douglas & Co.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the claim suggests continuity in Scott's employment and living arrangement, which is contradicted by the chapter outline and book summary.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation but rather a misrepresentation of the events as outlined in the chapter and summary.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as Scott's employment and living situation change over the course of the story.

Since the atomic parts are not grounded in the events and the relationship is not valid, the claim is INVALID."
