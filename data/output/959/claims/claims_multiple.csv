   a. ""The golden peach pit that Button-Bright found"": This part is grounded in Chapter 11, where Button-Bright finds a peach with a golden pit.
   b. ""kept in his pocket"": This is implied in Chapter 24, where Button-Bright empties his pocket to reveal the golden peach pit.
   c. ""turned out to be the transformed Princess Ozma"": This is confirmed in Chapter 24, where the Little Pink Bear reveals that Ozma is in Button-Bright's pocket, and the peach pit is opened to reveal Ozma.
   d. ""as revealed by the Little Pink Bear"": This is grounded in Chapter 24, where the Little Pink Bear reveals Ozma's location.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The sequence of events from finding the peach pit to the revelation by the Little Pink Bear is coherent and follows a logical progression.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it ties together the mystery of Ozma's disappearance and the magical transformation.

   a. ""The golden apple core that Button-Bright found and kept in his pocket"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. Button-Bright finds a golden peach pit, not an apple core, as mentioned in Chapter 11, event 3, and Chapter 24, event 4.
   b. ""turned out to be the transformed Princess Ozma"": This part is grounded in Chapter 24, events 3 and 6, where the Little Pink Bear reveals that Ozma is in Button-Bright's pocket, and the peach pit is opened to reveal Ozma.
   c. ""as revealed by the Little Pink Bear"": This part is grounded in Chapter 24, event 3, where the Little Pink Bear reveals Ozma's location.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid because the claim incorrectly identifies the object as a ""golden apple core"" instead of a ""golden peach pit."" This misidentification affects the accuracy of the claim.

   c. The relationship does not contradict the summary or outline, but the incorrect identification of the object makes the claim inaccurate.

Since the claim contains an incorrect detail about the object (apple core instead of peach pit), it is not fully grounded in the chapter outline, making the claim INVALID."
