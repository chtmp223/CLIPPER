Frank Merriwell, a freshman at Yale, is an exceptional young man with a knack for getting into and out of trouble. Having passed his entrance exams with the help of his guardian, Professor Scotch, Frank begins his college life with a mix of excitement and challenges. He quickly becomes a target of the sophomore class, particularly their leader, Bruce Browning, who sees Frank as a threat due to his popularity and athletic prowess.

Frank's roommate, Harry Rattleton, is a lively and sometimes excitable fellow from Ohio who shares Frank's interest in sports. Together, they navigate the social and academic life at Yale, forming friendships and rivalries. Frank's athletic abilities soon become evident, making him a valuable member of the freshman crew and baseball team. His skill and cool demeanor earn him the respect of his peers and the attention of the upperclassmen.

Despite his talents, Frank's path is not without obstacles. He faces off against Jack Diamond, a fiery Southerner with whom he has a complicated relationship. Their rivalry culminates in a duel with rapiers, where Frank's fencing skills, honed during his time at Fardale Military Academy, help him disarm Diamond twice, showcasing his prowess and earning him further admiration.

Frank's popularity is not limited to his athletic achievements. His refusal to drink or smoke, while initially a point of ridicule, becomes a testament to his character, and he gains the respect of his classmates for his principles. His leadership and strategic thinking are further demonstrated when he orchestrates a successful counter-hazing operation against the sophomores, leading a group of freshmen disguised as Indians to capture and humiliate their rivals, including Browning.

Throughout his first year, Frank's integrity and determination shine through. He maintains a balanced focus on academics and athletics, even as he becomes embroiled in various escapades and confrontations. His ability to remain calm under pressure and his fair-mindedness win him allies and help him navigate the complexities of college life.

Frank's journey at Yale is marked by his ability to adapt and excel in different situations, whether it's on the sports field, in the classroom, or in the social arena. His encounters with characters like Browning, Diamond, and Ditson highlight his growth and the challenges of becoming a leader among his peers. As Frank continues to rise to prominence, he remains true to his values, setting an example for others and solidifying his place as a beloved figure at Yale.
