   a. ""The attempted bribery of Montague's cleaning woman for his discarded papers"": This part is grounded in event 2 of Chapter 3, where Montague learns from a cleaning woman about the bribery attempt.
   b. ""is corroborated by Venable's accounts of corporate espionage tactics, including wire-tapping and mail interception"": This part is grounded in events 4 and 6 of Chapter 3, where Major Venable explains corporate rivalries and shares stories about espionage tactics.

   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly supported by the chapter outline, which discusses both the bribery attempt and the espionage tactics.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the claim incorrectly identifies the person involved in the bribery attempt as Montague's secretary, whereas the outline mentions a cleaning woman. This discrepancy undermines the claim's validity.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation, as it attempts to link the bribery attempt with Venable's accounts of espionage tactics without a direct connection in the outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the claim misrepresents the details of the bribery attempt.

Since the claim misidentifies the person involved in the bribery attempt and lacks a direct connection between the bribery and Venable's accounts, it is not coherent with the chapter outline."
