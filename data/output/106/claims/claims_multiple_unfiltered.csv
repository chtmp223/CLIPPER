   a. Bukawai, the witch-doctor, exploits Momaya's concern for her missing son Tibo by first offering to help find him: This part is partially grounded in the chapter outline. In Chapter 5, Momaya seeks help from Bukawai to find her son, but there is no explicit mention of Bukawai offering to help. The summary does not provide additional context for this part.
   b. Bukawai later kidnaps Tibo himself and threatens him with hyenas in a cave: This part is grounded in Chapter 6, where Bukawai kidnaps Tibo and takes him to a cave, threatening him with hyenas.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship suggests a sequence of events where Bukawai initially pretends to help and then kidnaps Tibo. However, the outline does not explicitly state that Bukawai offered help before kidnapping Tibo. The relationship is not fully supported by the outline.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation, as the outline does not explicitly state Bukawai's intentions or actions as exploiting Momaya's concern.
   c. The relationship does not contradict any information in the summary or outline, but it lacks explicit support for the claim that Bukawai offered to help before kidnapping Tibo.

In Chapter 5, Momaya finds Tibo by chance in the jungle, and there is no mention of Bukawai helping her find Tibo. In Chapter 6, Bukawai kidnaps Tibo, which contradicts the idea of him helping Momaya.
   b. Bukawai rescues Tibo from hyenas in a cave: This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. In Chapter 6, it is Tarzan who rescues Tibo from the hyenas, not Bukawai.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid because both parts of the claim are not supported by the chapter outline. Bukawai does not help Momaya find Tibo, nor does he rescue Tibo from hyenas.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship contradicts the information in the chapter outline, where Bukawai is portrayed as an antagonist who kidnaps Tibo.
