   a. ""The Meredith children's lack of proper supervision leads to various misbehaviors"": This part is grounded in both the book summary and Chapter 2 outline. The summary mentions that the Meredith children have not been properly brought up due to their father's preoccupation with theology and their aunt's limitations. Chapter 2 also discusses the children's behavior and lack of supervision.
   b. ""resulting in self-imposed punishments through their Good-Conduct Club"": This part is grounded in the book summary, which describes Jem Blythe forming the Good-Conduct Club to help the Merediths behave better, and in Chapter 23, where the children agree to form the club and establish rules for self-punishment.
   c. ""occasional interventions from their father"": This part is grounded in the book summary, which mentions Mr. Meredith's guilt over his failings as a father, and in Chapter 33, where Mr. Meredith confronts Carl about a prank and considers punishing him.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The lack of supervision logically leads to misbehavior, which in turn results in the children forming the Good-Conduct Club to self-regulate.

   a. ""The Meredith children's strict supervision leads to various misbehaviors"": This part is not grounded in the book summary or chapter outline.

However, the term ""harsh punishments"" is subjective and not explicitly supported by the text. Mr. Meredith's inability to whip Carl suggests a reluctance to administer harsh punishment.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the premise of strict supervision is incorrect. The children's misbehavior is attributed to a lack of supervision, not strictness.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it misrepresents the cause of the children's behavior and the nature of the consequences they face.
