The story unfolds in Boyd City, a bustling mining town in the Midwest, where a young man named Dick Falkner arrives in search of work. His journey begins with hardship, as he struggles to find employment and food, ultimately fainting from hunger. Dick's perseverance pays off when he secures a job with George Udell, a local printer known for his skeptical views on religion. Despite their differences, Udell and Dick form a bond, with Udell appreciating Dick's work ethic and skill.

As Dick settles into his new life, he becomes involved with the Jerusalem Church's Young People's Society, thanks to his friendship with Charlie Bowen, a member of the church. The society is focused on practical Christian work, a theme emphasized by their pastor, Rev. James Cameron, who advocates for a more active, service-oriented church. This resonates with Dick, who is disillusioned by the church's failure to address real-world issues.

Throughout the story, Dick encounters Amy Goodrich, the daughter of a wealthy and influential church member, Adam Goodrich. Despite coming from vastly different backgrounds, Dick and Amy are drawn to each other. However, their budding relationship faces obstacles, primarily due to Adam's disdain for Dick's humble origins and past as a tramp.

The narrative explores themes of redemption, societal expectations, and the transformative power of sincere Christian faith. Dick's journey from a homeless wanderer to a respected member of the community is marked by his integrity and determination. His character challenges the superficial judgments of society, as he proves that worth is not determined by wealth or social standing but by one's actions and heart.

The Young People's Society, under the influence of Rev. Cameron's teachings, undertakes the establishment of a reading room, aiming to provide a wholesome environment for the city's youth. This initiative reflects the story's central message: the importance of applying Christian principles to everyday life, rather than merely professing them.

As the story progresses, Dick's and Amy's paths continue to intertwine amid misunderstandings and societal pressures. Amy's brother, Frank, warns their father about Dick's intentions, further complicating matters. Despite these challenges, Amy remains supportive of Dick, recognizing his genuine character and potential.

The book culminates in a series of personal and communal transformations. The community of Boyd City gradually embraces the practical application of Christianity, as advocated by Rev. Cameron and embodied by Dick's journey. The narrative concludes with a hopeful outlook, as Dick's integrity and the society's efforts bring about positive change in the city, illustrating the enduring impact of true Christian values on individuals and communities alike.
