The black flag with stars and a golden sun spotted on various landmarks around the world between June 2nd and 9th was likely placed there by Robur's Albatross during its global journey.,The black flag with stars and a golden sun spotted on various landmarks around the world between June 2nd and 9th was placed there by hot air balloons from the Weldon Institute.,"Chapter 1 mentions mysterious sightings of a black flag with stars and a golden sun on landmarks worldwide. Later, in Chapter 14, we learn that the Albatross is capable of hovering over cities and creating spectacles with its lights. This suggests that Robur's aircraft was responsible for the earlier sightings, as it had the capability to reach various landmarks globally and create visual displays.","This corrupted fact attributes the flag sightings to the Weldon Institute's hot air balloons, which is incorrect as the institute's balloon, the Go-Ahead, was not yet operational during the time of the sightings.","Chapter 1, 14","- Chapter 1, item 7: Between June 2nd and 9th, a black flag with stars and a golden sun is spotted on various landmarks around the world.
