The narrative begins with the unnamed narrator recounting his encounter with a sale notice for the belongings of a deceased woman, Marguerite Gautier, a renowned courtesan in Paris. Intrigued, he attends the sale and observes the lavish lifestyle she once led, noting the societal women who are eager to glimpse the life of someone they had envied and judged. The narrator, fascinated by Marguerite's life and death, purchases a book, "Manon Lescaut," which bears an inscription from a man named Armand Duval.

The story then shifts to Armand Duval, who had been deeply in love with Marguerite. Through a series of flashbacks and letters, Armand recounts his passionate and tumultuous relationship with her. Armand first sees Marguerite at the theatre and is immediately captivated by her beauty and presence. Despite her status as a courtesan, Armand falls deeply in love with her, and they begin a relationship.

Marguerite, who is suffering from consumption, tries to change her lifestyle for Armand. She sells her possessions and attempts to live a simpler life with him in the countryside. However, societal pressures and financial difficulties strain their relationship. Armand's father, concerned about his son's future, intervenes and persuades Marguerite to leave Armand for his own good. Marguerite, genuinely in love with Armand, sacrifices her happiness and returns to her former life, hoping to secure a better future for him.

Armand, unaware of the true reason for Marguerite's departure, is devastated and believes she has betrayed him. In his anguish, he attempts to hurt her by flaunting a new relationship with another woman, Olympe. Meanwhile, Marguerite's health deteriorates, and she dies alone, misunderstood by those around her.

The narrative returns to the present, where Armand visits Marguerite's grave and learns of her sacrifices through a letter she left behind. He is filled with remorse and guilt, realizing the depth of her love and the extent of her sacrifice. The story concludes with Armand's reflection on the nature of love, forgiveness, and the societal judgments that overshadow true affection.

Throughout the narrative, themes of love, sacrifice, and societal judgment are explored, highlighting the tragic consequences of misunderstanding and the societal constraints on personal happiness. The story of Marguerite Gautier serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities of love and the harsh realities faced by those who live on the fringes of society.
