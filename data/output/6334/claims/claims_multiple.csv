   a. Morton's killing of a wild goose: This part is grounded in event 2 of Chapter 4, where Morton kills a wild goose with a rock near a cove.
   b. Keeping it for the family's dinner: The outline does not mention Morton keeping the goose for dinner. Instead, event 3 of Chapter 4 states that Sara convinces Morton to sell the goose to Mrs. Norris for baby's milk money.
   c. Demonstrates their abundance of resources: This part is not grounded in the chapter outline or the book summary. The act of selling the goose for milk money suggests a lack of resources rather than abundance.
   d. Sara later reflects on when planning for a comfortable winter: In Chapter 9, Sara contemplates their dire financial situation, worrying about food and firewood for the winter, which contradicts the notion of abundance.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid, as the claim incorrectly interprets the events. The selling of the goose for milk money indicates financial need, not abundance.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship contradicts the information in the chapter outline and the book summary, which highlight the family's financial struggles.

Since the claim misrepresents the events and their implications, it is INVALID."
