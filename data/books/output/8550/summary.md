In a lively and engaging narrative set at Bannister College, the story revolves around T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., a sunny and carefree Senior known for his comedic antics and his love for music and fun. Hicks is beloved on campus for his generous and friendly nature, despite his lack of athletic prowess, which is a source of disappointment to his father, a former athletic star. Hicks has vowed to win his college letter, a B, in three sports before he graduates, a promise that seems increasingly unlikely as he nears the end of his college years.

The story takes a turn when Hicks promises to find a Herculean full-back for the college football team, a seemingly impossible task. True to his word, Hicks returns with John Thorwald, a massive and powerful freshman of Norwegian descent, whom he dubs "Thor, the Prodigious Prodigy." Thor quickly proves to be an unstoppable force on the field, raising hopes that Bannister will win the State Championship.

However, Thor is a complex character, stolid and slow to grasp the nuances of college life beyond academics. He has spent much of his life working and studying to fulfill a promise to his dying mother to gain an education, and he struggles to understand the camaraderie and spirit of college athletics. Despite his physical prowess, Thor's lack of enthusiasm and understanding of college spirit becomes a concern for the team, threatening to undermine their morale.

The story also delves into the personal struggles of Hicks, who is determined to win his B to fulfill his father's dreams. Despite his failures in various sports, Hicks remains optimistic and continues to try, buoyed by the support of his friends and the knowledge that his father is proud of his efforts.

As the narrative unfolds, Hicks and his friends work to help Thor understand the true meaning of college life and spirit. The turning point comes when Thor receives a letter informing him that he must leave college due to financial difficulties, just as he begins to understand what he might miss. This realization, coupled with the support of his friends, particularly the loyal and timid Theophilus Opperdyke, helps Thor begin to awaken to the broader aspects of college life beyond study and athletics.

The story is a rich tapestry of college life, filled with humor, friendship, and the pursuit of personal and collective goals. It highlights the importance of perseverance, the power of friendship, and the journey of self-discovery and growth. As Hicks and Thor navigate their respective challenges, they both learn valuable lessons about loyalty, ambition, and the true spirit of their Alma Mater.
