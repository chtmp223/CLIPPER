Tom Swift, a young inventor living in Shopton, New York, is working on an experimental airship with his collaborator, Mr. John Sharp, an aeronaut and balloonist. They are assisted by Tom's father, Barton Swift, who is also an inventor, and Garret Jackson, an engineer. The Swift household includes Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper, and Eradicate Sampson, a local handyman with his mule, Boomerang. The airship, named Red Cloud, is designed to function both as an aeroplane and a dirigible, with a unique aluminum gas container filled with a powerful gas.

Tom and Mr. Sharp face challenges in perfecting the airship, including an explosion during a gas test. Meanwhile, Tom's friend, Ned Newton, a bank employee, reports suspicious men in town, leading Tom to suspect the involvement of a gang led by Anson Morse, who previously caused trouble for the Swifts.

Despite these concerns, Tom and Mr. Sharp successfully test the Red Cloud, drawing attention from the townspeople and even an encounter with Tom's friend, Mary Nestor, at her seminary. The airship's capabilities are further demonstrated when it wins a prize at an aero carnival, besting a Frenchman's monoplane in a race.

The plot thickens when Tom is confronted by Anson Morse, who threatens him. The situation is defused by Eradicate Sampson's timely intervention with a bucket of whitewash. Tom and Mr. Sharp decide to embark on a long flight with the airship, but they need a third crew member. Mr. Swift declines, as he is preoccupied with a new invention involving a submarine, hinting at future adventures.

The narrative takes a turn when Mr. Wakefield Damon, a friend of Tom's, arrives at the Swift home in a runaway automobile, pursued by men he believes are part of Morse's gang. Mr. Damon, known for his eccentric expressions, narrowly escapes harm and expresses interest in joining Tom and Mr. Sharp on their airship expedition. This resolves the issue of the third crew member, setting the stage for their upcoming journey.

Throughout the story, Tom Swift's ingenuity and bravery are highlighted as he navigates challenges both technical and personal, all while maintaining his focus on innovation and adventure. The narrative blends elements of suspense, humor, and technological exploration, characteristic of the Tom Swift series.
