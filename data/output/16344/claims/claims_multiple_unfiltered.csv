2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The sequence of events is clear: O'Donoghan begins to reveal information, is interrupted by Tudor Brown's violent act, and then Mr. Hersebom responds by shooting Tudor Brown.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline. There is no contradiction with the book summary, as the summary does not detail these specific events but focuses on the broader narrative.
