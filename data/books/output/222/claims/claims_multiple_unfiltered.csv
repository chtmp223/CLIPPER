Without knowing the year of Strickland's death, we cannot definitively establish the sequence.

   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is a logical sequence of events based on the chapter outlines.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline. The summary describes Strickland's life in Tahiti as a time when he finds inspiration and creates significant works, which aligns with the idea of him living off the land and focusing on his art.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship suggests a temporal progression from one state to another, implying that Strickland's life in Tahiti changed from living off the land to working on a plantation. However, the chapter outlines do not provide a direct temporal sequence or causal link between these two states. The events are described in separate chapters without a clear indication that one followed the other.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline. The summary does not mention Strickland working as an overseer, nor does it suggest a progression from one lifestyle to another in Tahiti.
   c. The relationship does not contradict any information in the summary or outline, but it lacks explicit support for the suggested evolution.

Since the relationship between the atomic parts is not explicitly supported by the chapter outline or summary, and it is a subjective interpretation, the claim is INVALID."
