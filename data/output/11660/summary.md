Ethel Morton, known as Ethel "Blue" due to her eye color, lives with her cousin Ethel "Brown" and their family in a quaint house where the two Ethels, along with their cousin Dorothy Smith, enjoy the simple pleasures of life. The girls, all with birthdays in January, celebrate together with a family tradition of a shared party. This year, their grandmother Mrs. Emerson treated them to an exciting day in New York City, which they considered part of their birthday festivities.

The story unfolds in a cozy domestic setting during a snowy January afternoon. The girls are joined by Ethel Brown's brother Roger and little brother Dicky, who is fascinated by the beauty of snowflakes magnified under a glass. The conversation turns to the wonders of nature and the microscopic world, sparking Ethel Blue's ambition to own a microscope someday.

Helen, another cousin, joins the group and shares her knowledge of biology, explaining the basics of cell life and plant growth. This inspires a lively discussion about plants, leading to the idea of starting a garden. The children plan to grow a variety of plants, including sweetpeas, which Roger is particularly fond of. They agree on the idea of having a garden competition, with each child taking responsibility for different plants.

The Mortons and their cousins are part of the United Service Club (U.S.C.), a group dedicated to community service. Roger shares his excitement about a new project proposed by Mr. Wheeler, the high school master. The plan is to create a community garden for the local school children, particularly those living in less fortunate circumstances near the mill. The U.S.C. members are tasked with spreading the word and helping organize the project, which aims to transform a neglected dump into a thriving garden.

The story highlights the children's enthusiasm and teamwork as they work together to make the garden a success. They register children for plots, organize supplies, and learn about gardening from Mr. Wheeler and other community members. The garden becomes a place of learning and joy, with the children taking pride in their work and the produce they grow.

Meanwhile, the Ethels and Dorothy are inspired to beautify their own home gardens, planning color-themed flower beds and experimenting with different plant varieties. They are particularly excited about creating a pink garden and a blue garden, each filled with a variety of blossoms that will bloom throughout the season.

As spring progresses, the children spend more time outdoors, exploring the woods and discovering the wonders of nature. They find a hidden cave, which they clean and furnish as a secret clubhouse, complete with a makeshift kitchen and storage for their supplies. The cave becomes a place for picnics and adventures, where they can escape and enjoy the beauty of the natural world.

The story captures the essence of childhood curiosity and the joy of discovery, as the children learn about plants, animals, and the environment around them. Through their efforts, they not only beautify their community but also strengthen their bonds of friendship and family. The narrative is a heartwarming tale of youthful enthusiasm, the power of collaboration, and the simple pleasures of life in a close-knit community.
