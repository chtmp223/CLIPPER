    a. ""After swimming across the moat of Condillac"": This part is grounded in event 7 of Chapter 18, where Garnache swims across the moat and escapes into the countryside.
    b. ""Garnache embarks on a four-league journey south to Grenoble"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. In Chapter 19, Garnache starts running north from Condillac to Voiron, not south to Grenoble.
    c. ""which takes him six hours to complete before he reaches the inn of the Beau Paon"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The outline mentions a three-hour journey to Voiron, not six hours to Grenoble.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not valid because the direction and destination mentioned in the claim (south to Grenoble) contradict the chapter outline (north to Voiron).
    b. The relationship is not explicitly stated in the summary or outline and is based on incorrect information.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the claim contains incorrect details about the journey's direction, destination, and duration.

Since parts 1b., 1c., and 2a. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
