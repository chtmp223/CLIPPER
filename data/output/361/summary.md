Bertram and Billy Henshaw's wedding marks the beginning of a new chapter in their lives. Billy, a spirited and impulsive young woman, is deeply in love with Bertram, an artist known for his portraits. The couple's happiness, however, is soon challenged by the complexities of married life and the expectations of those around them.

Bertram's sister, Mrs. Kate Hartwell, is skeptical of their union, fearing that Billy's impulsive nature and lack of domestic skills will hinder Bertram's artistic career. Despite this, Billy is determined to be a good wife and manage her household effectively. She struggles with her role, feeling pressure to live up to societal expectations and her own desire to support Bertram's work.

As Bertram immerses himself in his art, particularly in painting a portrait of Marguerite Winthrop, Billy feels increasingly isolated. She attempts to find fulfillment by engaging in various activities, including music, social gatherings, and charity work. However, she is haunted by a book titled "When the Honeymoon Wanes," which suggests that a wife's over-attention to her husband can stifle a marriage.

Billy's efforts to balance her life and marriage lead to a series of misunderstandings and challenges. She grapples with feelings of jealousy and insecurity, particularly regarding Bertram's work and his interactions with other women. Despite her attempts to be supportive, she occasionally feels neglected and misunderstood.

Bertram, on the other hand, is struggling with his own challenges. After breaking his arm, he fears he may never paint again, which adds to his frustration and restlessness. His inability to communicate his worries to Billy creates further tension between them.

The couple's relationship is tested further when Bertram begins spending more time with his old friends, including Bob Seaver, which raises suspicions and concerns for Billy. She fears that Bertram is seeking solace outside their marriage, which exacerbates her insecurities.

Amidst these trials, the couple's love for each other remains strong. They navigate their differences and misunderstandings, learning to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses. Bertram eventually finds a way to continue painting, even with his injured arm, and Billy learns to trust in their relationship and her own abilities.

Throughout the story, Billy's vibrant personality and determination shine through. Her journey reflects the challenges and joys of marriage, highlighting the importance of communication, trust, and mutual support. As Billy and Bertram grow together, they come to understand that love is not without its trials, but it is these very challenges that strengthen their bond and deepen their affection for one another.
