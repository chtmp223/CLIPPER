In a bustling corner of Brooklyn, Roger Mifflin operates his second-hand bookshop, charmingly named the Haunted Bookshop. Mifflin, a passionate bibliophile, believes in the profound impact of books on humanity and dreams of spreading literary enlightenment. His wife, Helen, supports his endeavors, and their tranquil life is briefly interrupted by the arrival of Titania Chapman, the daughter of a wealthy businessman, who comes to learn the book trade.

Titania, a vibrant young woman, is eager to dive into the world of books, despite her father's concerns about her being spoiled by a life of privilege. Her presence adds a new dynamic to the shop, and she quickly becomes the center of attention for Aubrey Gilbert, a young advertising agent. Aubrey, who visits the shop on business, is immediately smitten with Titania and finds himself drawn into the Mifflins' world.

The narrative takes a mysterious turn when a series of strange events unfold around a particular book, Carlyle's "Oliver Cromwell." The book disappears from the shop, only to be returned under suspicious circumstances. Aubrey, who has taken a keen interest in Titania's safety, becomes entangled in a web of intrigue that seems to involve German spies and a plot that could have dire consequences.

As Aubrey investigates, he encounters a shady chef from the Octagon Hotel and a cryptic telephone warning that Gissing Street is dangerous for him. His suspicions are heightened by a violent attack on the Brooklyn Bridge, where he narrowly escapes being thrown into the river. Determined to protect Titania and uncover the truth, Aubrey takes lodgings across from the bookshop to keep a vigilant watch.

Roger Mifflin, meanwhile, is absorbed in his literary pursuits, blissfully unaware of the danger lurking around his shop. He is invited to Philadelphia to appraise a library, a task that flatters his sense of professional pride. Titania, left to manage the shop in his absence, continues to charm customers and learns the ropes of bookselling with enthusiasm.

The plot thickens as Aubrey discovers that the chef and a local druggist, Weintraub, are involved in a sinister conspiracy. The rebinding of the Cromwell book and the discovery of its cover in the drugstore hint at a deeper plot. Aubrey's fears are confirmed when he overhears a conversation suggesting a plan that must be completed by Sunday.

In the backdrop of these events, Roger reflects on the power of literature to shape society and dreams of a world where booksellers play a crucial role in fostering peace and understanding. His philosophical musings provide a counterpoint to the unfolding drama, highlighting the tension between the idealism of books and the harsh realities of the world.

Aubrey's determination to protect Titania and unravel the mystery leads to a climactic confrontation in the bookshop, where he thwarts a plot involving a bomb hidden in the Cromwell book. The explosive device, intended for nefarious purposes, is neutralized, and the conspirators are apprehended, thanks to Aubrey's courage and quick thinking.

In the aftermath, the Mifflins express their gratitude to Aubrey, and Mr. Chapman, impressed by Aubrey's bravery, offers him a position in his company. The experience strengthens the bonds between the characters, and Titania's foray into the world of bookselling proves transformative, enriching her understanding of life and literature.

The story concludes with a sense of renewed purpose and hope, as the characters look forward to a future where books and the ideals they represent continue to inspire and enlighten. The Haunted Bookshop, with its eclectic mix of volumes and its dedicated proprietor, remains a beacon of literary magic in the heart of Brooklyn.
