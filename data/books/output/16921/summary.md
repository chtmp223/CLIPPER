In the novel, we follow the crew of the Solar Queen, a Free Trader spaceship, as they navigate a complex series of events on the alien planet Sargol. The story begins with Dane Thorson, a Cargo-master-apprentice, preparing for trade negotiations with the native Salariki, a feline-like race. The crew's objective is to secure a trading contract for the highly valuable Koros stones, which are gems unique to Sargol.

The setting is the planet Sargol, known for its aromatic and colorful flora, which plays a significant role in the cultural practices of the Salariki. The crew faces cultural barriers and the challenge of understanding the Salariki's customs to successfully negotiate the trade.

Key characters include Captain Jellico, the stern and experienced leader of the Solar Queen; Van Rycke, the shrewd and patient Cargo-master; Rip Shannon, the assistant Astrogator; and Ali Kamil, the Engineer-apprentice. Each character brings their own expertise to the mission, but it is Dane's actions that inadvertently complicate their situation.

During the trade negotiations, Dane learns that the Salariki have a strong affinity for catnip, a Terran plant. This discovery initially seems to offer an advantage, but it also introduces unforeseen complications. The crew's efforts are further complicated by the presence of a rival Inter-Solar (I-S) Company ship, whose crew is also vying for the lucrative Koros trade.

Tensions rise when the I-S crew challenges the Solar Queen's crew to a duel, a traditional Salariki practice. Captain Jellico represents the Free Traders and, through skill and cunning, wins the duel, securing the crew's position with the Salariki.

However, the situation takes a dire turn when members of the Solar Queen's crew, including Frank Mura and Karl Kosti, fall ill with a mysterious disease. The illness, which causes severe headaches and a comatose state, spreads among the crew, leaving only a few members, including Dane, unaffected. The crew suspects that the illness might be linked to their time on Sargol or possibly a deliberate sabotage by the I-S Company.

As the crew struggles to find a cure, they are forced to consider the possibility of being labeled a plague ship, which would result in their destruction to prevent the spread of disease. The crew's only hope lies in discovering the source of the illness and proving their innocence before they reach Terra.

In a race against time, Dane, Rip, Ali, and Weeks work tirelessly to care for their sick crewmates and search for clues. They suspect that their immunity to the disease might be linked to a ceremonial drink they consumed on Sargol, but without a clear understanding or a sample of the drink, they are at a loss.

Captain Jellico's foresight leads them to alter their course towards the asteroid belt, avoiding detection and giving them time to investigate the illness further. The crew's suspicions about the I-S Company's involvement grow, especially after hearing a warning broadcast labeling the Solar Queen as a plague ship.

The novel presents a gripping tale of survival, trade, and intrigue as the crew of the Solar Queen battles against time, disease, and corporate rivals to secure their future and prove their innocence. The story explores themes of cultural understanding, the dangers of space exploration, and the cutthroat nature of interstellar commerce.
