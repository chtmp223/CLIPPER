Tom Slade, a young scout with a strong sense of duty and patriotism, finds himself at a crossroads as his desire to contribute to the war effort conflicts with the responsibilities laid out for him by his scoutmaster, Mr. Ellsworth. Set against the backdrop of World War I, Tom's journey begins with a special scout meeting where Mr. Ellsworth advises him to exercise patience and follow the path outlined for scouts by the government. Tom, however, is restless and frustrated by the limitations of his current duties, which include tasks like rolling bandages and planting seeds. His longing to fight for his country is further complicated by the teasing of his peers, Roy Blakeley and Pee-wee Harris, and his own internal struggle with feeling inadequate.

The narrative unfolds as Tom grapples with his commitment to his scoutmaster and the allure of enlisting in the army. His resolve is tested when he encounters Roscoe Bent, a charming young man who works at the bank and is admired by many, including Tom. Roscoe's influence and Tom's own sense of inadequacy lead him to make a fateful decision. He decides to pawn his Gold Cross, a symbol of his bravery and achievements as a scout, to finance a trip to find Roscoe, who has run away to avoid registering for the draft.

Tom's journey takes him to a remote mountain where he confronts Roscoe, persuading him to return and fulfill his duty by registering. This act of courage and selflessness comes at a personal cost, as Tom misses his chance to participate in a significant town rally and is subsequently misunderstood by those who knew him, including Mr. Ellsworth. Despite the misunderstanding, Tom remains steadfast in his belief that he did the right thing.

The story takes a dramatic turn when Tom, in an effort to prove his worth and continue serving his country, joins a ship's crew bound for Europe. His adventure at sea is fraught with danger, including a close encounter with a German spy who plants a bomb on the ship. Tom's keen sense of observation and quick thinking avert disaster, earning him the respect of the ship's crew and the Secret Service.

Upon his return to Bridgeboro, Tom's actions and the truth of his character come to light during a community meeting where Roscoe Bent, now a soldier, publicly acknowledges Tom's role in his own journey to redemption. The meeting serves as a turning point, not only for Roscoe but for Tom as well, as he is finally recognized for his bravery and integrity.

The narrative concludes with Tom and Roscoe reaffirming their friendship and Tom's quiet return to the life he left behind, now with a deeper understanding of his place in the world and the true meaning of honor and duty. Through his trials, Tom learns that the right path, though often fraught with challenges and misunderstandings, ultimately leads to fulfillment and recognition. His journey is a testament to the values of scouting and the enduring spirit of doing one's duty to God and country, even in the face of doubt and adversity.
