The story revolves around Katy Carr, a lively and imaginative twelve-year-old girl, who lives in the town of Burnet with her family. The Carr family consists of six children: Katy, Clover, Elsie, Dorry, Johnnie, and little Phil. Their father, Dr. Carr, is a kind and busy man, often away attending to his patients. The children's mother passed away when Phil was a baby, leaving Aunt Izzie, Dr. Carr's sister, to take care of them. Aunt Izzie is a strict and particular woman who struggles to understand the high-spirited children, especially Katy, who is always full of plans and often gets into scrapes.

Katy, the eldest, is a dreamer with grand plans for the future, wanting to do something heroic and become famous. However, her plans often lead to misadventures, like when she gets into trouble at school for inventing a noisy game or when she falls out of a swing, resulting in a severe injury that confines her to bed. This accident becomes a turning point in Katy's life, as she must learn patience and resilience while being bedridden.

During her recovery, Katy receives a visit from her cousin Helen, who is also an invalid. Cousin Helen is a source of inspiration for Katy, teaching her the importance of patience, cheerfulness, and making the best of her situation. She encourages Katy to view her room as a school where she can learn valuable lessons, such as neatness and hopefulness. Helen's visit and advice help Katy see her illness as an opportunity to grow and to be a source of comfort to her family.

As Katy adjusts to her new circumstances, she becomes more thoughtful and considerate, realizing that she can still be of use to her siblings by making her room a welcoming place for them. This change in perspective helps Katy to become the "heart of the house," as Cousin Helen had suggested. With time, Katy learns to manage her emotions better and finds joy in small things, setting an example for her younger siblings.

Throughout the story, Katy's relationships with her family members evolve. She becomes closer to her siblings, especially Elsie, who is deeply devoted to her. Katy also learns to appreciate Aunt Izzie's efforts and kindness, recognizing the love and care behind her strict demeanor. The novel highlights the themes of personal growth, the importance of family, and the power of kindness and patience in overcoming adversity.

Katy's journey from a careless, dreamy girl to a thoughtful and loving sister is marked by her ability to adapt to her limitations and find strength in her challenges. Her story is one of resilience and transformation, as she learns to navigate the complexities of life with grace and optimism.
