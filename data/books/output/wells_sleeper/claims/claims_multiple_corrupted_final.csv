Graham's sleeplessness for six nights in Boscastle led to a trance that lasted for twenty years.,Graham's sleeplessness for six months in Boscastle led to a trance that lasted for twenty years.,"In Chapter 1, the stranger (later identified as Graham) reveals he hasn't slept for six nights. Chapter 2 confirms that Graham fell into a trance in Boscastle, and it's mentioned that this trance lasted for twenty years. This fact connects the initial sleeplessness with the prolonged trance state.","The corrupted fact changes the duration of Graham's initial sleeplessness from six nights to six months, which is inconsistent with the information provided in Chapter 1.","Chapter 1, 2","- Chapter 1, item 2: The stranger reveals he hasn't slept for six nights.
- Chapter 2, item 2: Isbister recalls the initial incident when Graham fell into the trance in Boscastle.
- Chapter 2, item 3: The two men discuss the changes that have occurred in their lives and the world during Graham's twenty-year sleep.
- Relationship: Temporal progression of Graham's sleep",Unique,Valid claim,INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Graham's sleeplessness for six nights in Boscastle"": This part is grounded in Chapter 1, where the stranger (later identified as Graham) reveals to Isbister that he hasn't slept for six nights.
   b. ""led to a trance that lasted for twenty years"": This part is partially grounded in Chapter 2, where it is mentioned that Graham fell into a trance in Boscastle and remained unconscious for a prolonged period. However, the chapter outline specifies that the trance lasted for over two centuries, not twenty years, which contradicts the claim.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship suggests causation, implying that the sleeplessness directly led to the trance. While the sleeplessness is a significant detail, the direct causal link to the trance is not explicitly stated in the summary or outline.
   b. The relationship is not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline, as the duration of the trance is inaccurately represented in the claim.
   c. The relationship contradicts the information in the summary and outline regarding the duration of the trance.

Since the claim contains a factual inaccuracy regarding the duration of the trance and lacks explicit support for the causal relationship, it is INVALID."

- Relationship: Graham's transition from trance to awakening",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""Upon awakening from his trance, Graham finds himself naked with a rubber apparatus on his arm"": This part is grounded in Chapter 3, events 1 and 2, where Graham regains consciousness and discovers he is naked with a rubber apparatus bound to his arm.
    b. ""is later provided with new clothes created by a futuristic machine"": This part is grounded in Chapter 4, event 4, where a tailor uses a futuristic machine to create new clothes for Graham.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The sequence of events is logical: Graham awakens, finds himself naked, and is later provided with clothes.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly grounded in the chapter outline.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it follows the progression of events after Graham awakens from his trance.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID."

- Relationship: Future transportation systems",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""The future world Graham awakens to features a complex system of moving platforms as roads"": This part is grounded in event 2 of Chapter 5, where Graham observes moving platforms serving as roads in the future city.
   b. ""Eadhamite roads, replacing traditional transportation methods like railroads"": This part is grounded in event 6 of Chapter 14, where the attendant officer explains the new transportation systems, including Eadhamite roads and the absence of railroads.

- Relationship: Rebellion against the Council",Unique,Valid claim,INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Graham's escape from confinement is facilitated by rebels"": This part is grounded in Chapter 8, where rebels contact Graham through a ventilator and help him escape.
   b. ""who are part of a larger revolt against the Council"": This part is consistent with Chapter 9, where Lincoln informs Graham about the ongoing revolt against the Council.
   c. ""led by Ostrog and his half-brother Lincoln"": This part is partially grounded. Chapter 9 mentions Lincoln, Ostrog's half-brother, informing Graham about the revolt, but it does not explicitly state that Ostrog is leading the revolt. The summary indicates Ostrog is a cunning leader seeking to control the Sleeper, but it does not confirm his leadership of the revolt.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship between Graham's escape and the larger revolt is meaningful and consistent with the narrative of a rebellion against the Council.
   b. The claim that Ostrog is leading the revolt is a subjective interpretation not explicitly stated in the summary or outline. The summary suggests Ostrog's ambition but does not confirm his leadership role in the revolt.
   c. The relationship between the escape and the revolt does not contradict the information in the summary or outline, but the specific leadership role of Ostrog is not clearly established.

Since part 1c. is not fully satisfied due to the lack of explicit confirmation of Ostrog's leadership in the revolt, the claim is INVALID."
