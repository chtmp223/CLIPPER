- Chapter 3, item 1: The narrator arrives at Mr. Weiss's house and finds Mr. Graves in a critical condition, diagnosing morphine poisoning.
- Relationship: Progression of Mr. Graves' condition and diagnosis",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""The doctor's initial examination of Mr. Graves suggested opium poisoning"": This part is grounded in Chapter 1, event 3, where the doctor examines Mr. Graves and considers opium poisoning as a possible cause of his stupor.
    b. ""Upon a subsequent visit, the condition was diagnosed as morphine poisoning"": This part is grounded in Chapter 3, event 1, where the narrator diagnoses Mr. Graves with morphine poisoning during a later visit.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The claim describes a progression in the doctor's understanding of Mr. Graves's condition from an initial suspicion of opium poisoning to a later diagnosis of morphine poisoning.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly supported by the chapter outline.

    a. ""The doctor's initial examination of Mr. Graves suggested morphine poisoning"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. In Chapter 1, the doctor suspects opium poisoning, not morphine poisoning. In Chapter 3, the doctor diagnoses morphine poisoning, but this is not the initial examination.
    b. ""Upon a subsequent visit, the condition was diagnosed as opium poisoning"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. In Chapter 3, the doctor diagnoses morphine poisoning, not opium poisoning.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not meaningful or valid because the claim incorrectly states the sequence and nature of the diagnoses. The initial examination suggested opium poisoning, and the subsequent visit confirmed morphine poisoning, not the other way around.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship contradicts the information in the chapter outline, which clearly states the sequence and nature of the diagnoses.

Since both atomic parts are not grounded in the chapter outline and the relationship is not valid, the claim is INVALID."

   b. ""the discovery of heavy bolts on the doors and shutters in the bedroom"": This part is grounded in event 4 of Chapter 9, where Thorndyke and Jervis find evidence of heavy bolts on the doors and shutters.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is meaningful and suggests a possible scenario where Mr. Graves might be held against his will. Mrs. Schallibaum's interruption could imply an effort to prevent Mr. Graves from revealing something important, and the heavy bolts suggest a physical means of confinement.
   b. The relationship is not merely a subjective interpretation; it is a logical inference based on the suspicious behavior and physical evidence described in the chapter outlines.
