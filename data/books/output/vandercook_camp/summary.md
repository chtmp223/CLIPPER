In a small town in New Hampshire, a young man named Billy Webster walks through the streets of Woodford, his mind occupied with thoughts that cloud his usually clear blue eyes. It's been two years since the Sunrise Hill Camp Fire members, a group of girls, have grown into young women. Among them, Margaret "Meg" Everett remains much the same with her sunny disposition, while Polly O'Neill, another member, has been stirring up concern.

Polly has been spending time with an actress, Miss Adams, who is visiting Woodford. This worries Billy, as Polly's mother, Mrs. Wharton, had insisted that Polly stay away from the stage for three years following a previous escapade. Billy, who has feelings for Polly, fears that her interest in acting might rekindle due to Miss Adams' influence. Meg, on the other hand, reassures him that Polly's mother has refused Miss Adams' invitation for Polly to travel to Europe, despite Polly's longing to see her friends Betty and Esther again.

Billy's concerns deepen when he visits the Wharton home and mistakenly confesses his feelings to Polly's twin sister, Mollie O'Neill, instead of Polly. This revelation leaves Mollie hurt, as she had been unaware of Billy's feelings for Polly. Billy, realizing his mistake, is deeply troubled by the unintended pain he's caused Mollie, with whom he shares a long-standing friendship.

Meanwhile, Polly's restlessness and yearning for a career on the stage are juxtaposed with her loyalty to her family and friends. Her mother, Mrs. Wharton, struggles with allowing Polly the freedom to pursue her dreams, fearing the changes it might bring. Polly, caught between her ambitions and her family's expectations, finds solace in her friendship with Meg and the memories of their Camp Fire days.

As the narrative unfolds, the complexities of relationships, personal growth, and the pursuit of dreams are explored. Polly's determination to follow her passion for acting, despite the obstacles, becomes a central theme. Her interactions with Billy, Meg, and Miss Adams highlight the tensions between societal expectations and personal desires.

The story weaves through various settings, from the small town of Woodford to the bustling streets of Berlin, where Esther Crippen, another Camp Fire member, is preparing for her musical debut. Esther's journey is marked by self-doubt and the pressure to succeed, driven by her love for her sister Betty and the desire to support her family.

In Berlin, Betty Ashton navigates her own challenges and opportunities, including unexpected inheritance news from Judge Maynard, which could change her and her family's fortunes. Her interactions with German admirers, particularly Carl von Reuter, add layers to her character as she balances personal interests with familial duties.

As the characters' paths intersect and diverge, themes of ambition, love, and self-discovery are intricately explored. The support and camaraderie among the Camp Fire girls remain a constant, providing strength and guidance as they each face their unique challenges. The story culminates in a celebration of friendship, resilience, and the courage to pursue one's dreams, set against the backdrop of changing times and evolving societal roles for women.
