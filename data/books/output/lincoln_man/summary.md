In a tropical setting, a mysterious man with a sailor's demeanor wanders through a rough part of Colon, where he enters a building with French windows. Inside, he observes a room filled with ne'er-do-wells, reminiscent of Port Said. The stranger, burdened by a troubled past and elusive memories, seeks solace in drink. His reflections are interrupted by an overheard conversation between two men discussing political dissatisfaction in Panama and potential international intrigue involving the United States. The older man, a Colombian, expresses deep-seated hatred for Americans and hints at a scheme to destabilize Panama, with the younger man, an American, seemingly complicit.

The narrative shifts to the United States, where a theft of naval plans from the Secretary of the Navy's office raises alarms. The Secretary recounts a bizarre encounter with a man claiming to have a message from the late Senator Carew, who collapses and then vanishes, leaving the plans missing. Meanwhile, in Washington, Cynthia Carew, niece of the murdered Senator, is overwhelmed by grief and a recurring nightmare about a door with cross-shaped panels. Eleanor Thornton, her friend, tries to comfort her as Cynthia struggles with the implications of her uncle's death and the arrest of Hamilton, the coachman, for the murder.

As the investigation unfolds, Douglas Hunter, an attach√© from the American Embassy in Tokyo, becomes involved. He partners with Detective Brett to unravel the mystery. They explore various leads, including family feuds and political rivalries, and question the involvement of Captain Frederick Lane, who had a public quarrel with the Senator. Lane's engagement to Cynthia adds complexity to the case, as does the discovery of a potential international conspiracy involving Panama and Japan.

Eleanor Thornton, a central figure in the narrative, is revealed to have received a cryptic message and a valuable necklace, suggesting she may be implicated in the Senator's murder. However, her intentions remain ambiguous as she is driven by a personal quest related to her father's mysterious disappearance years ago.

The story weaves through various settings, from the corridors of power in Washington to the haunted halls of Thornton's Nest, where another mysterious death occurs. The narrative explores themes of political intrigue, familial loyalty, and the quest for truth amid a backdrop of international tensions. As the characters navigate a web of deceit and hidden agendas, they confront their pasts and the consequences of their actions, culminating in revelations that challenge their understanding of loyalty and justice.
