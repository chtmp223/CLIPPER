## Chapter 1


T**HOSE LITTLE BASTARDS** were hiding out there in the tall grass. The moon was not quite full, but bright, and it was behind them, so I could see them as plain as day, though it was deep night. Lightning bugs flashed against the black canvas. I waited at Miss Watson’s kitchen door, rocked a loose step board with my foot, knew she was going to tell me to fix it tomorrow. I was waiting there for her to give me a pan of corn bread that she had made with my Sadie’s recipe. Waiting is a big part of a slave’s life, waiting and waiting to wait some more. Waiting for demands. Waiting for food. Waiting for the ends of days. Waiting for the just and deserved Christian reward at the end of it all.

Those white boys, Huck and Tom, watched me. They were always playing some kind of pretending game where I was either a villain or prey, but certainly their toy. They hopped about out there with the chiggers, mosquitoes and other biting bugs, but never made any progress toward me. It always pays to give white folks what they want, so I stepped into the yard and called out into the night,

“Who dat dere in da dark lak dat?”

They rustled clumsily about, giggled. Those boys couldn’t sneak up on a blind and deaf man while a band was playing. I would rather have been wasting time counting lightning bugs than bothering with them.

“I guess I jest gwyne set dese old bones down on dis heah porch and watch out for dat noise ’gin. Maybe dere be sum ol’ demon or witch out dere. I’m gwyne stay right heah where it be safe.” I sat on the top step and leaned back against the post. I was tired, so I closed my eyes.

The boys whispered excitedly to each other, and I could hear them, clear as a church bell.

“Is he ’sleep already?” Huck asked.

“I reckon so. I heard niggers can fall asleep jest like that,” Tom said and snapped his fingers.

“Shhhh,” Huck said.

“I say we ties him up,” Tom said. “Tie him up to dat porch post what he’s leaning ’ginst.”

“No,” said Huck. “What if’n he wakes up and makes a ruckus? Then I gets found out for being outside and not in bed like I’m supposed to be.”

“Okay. But you know what? I need me some candles. I’m gonna slip into Miss Watson’s kitchen and get me some.”

“What if’n you wake Jim?”

“I ain’t gonna wake nobody. Thunder can’t even wake a sleepin’ nigger. Don’t you know nuffin? Thunder, nor lightning, nor roarin’ lions. I hear tell of one that slept right through an earthquake.”

“What you suppose an earthquake feels like?” Huck asked.

“Like when you pa wakes you up in the middle of the night.”

The boys sneaked awkwardly, crawled knees over fists, and none too quietly across the complaining boards of the porch and inside through the Dutch door of Miss Watson’s kitchen. I heard them in there rifling about, opening cabinet doors and drawers. I kept my eyes closed and ignored a mosquito that landed on my arm.

“Here we go,” Tom said. “I gone jest take three.”

“You cain’t jest take an old lady’s candles,” Huck said. “That’s stealin’. What if’n they blamed Jim for that?”

“Here, I’ll leave her this here nickel. That’s more’n enough. They won’t ’spect no slave. Where a slave gonna git a nickel? Now, let’s git outta here befo’ she shows up.”

The boys stepped out onto the porch. I don’t imagine that they were hardly aware of all the noise they made.

“You shoulda left a note, too,” Huck said.

“No need for all that,” Tom said. “Nickel’s plenty.” I could feel the boys’ eyes turn to me. I remained still.

“What you doin’?” Huck asked.

“I’m gonna play a little joke on ol’ Jim.”

“You gonna wake him up is what you gonna do.”

“Hush up.”

Tom stepped behind me and grabbed my hat brim at my ears.

“Tom,” Huck complained.

“Shhhh.” Tom lifted my hat off my head. “I’s jest gonna hang this ol’ hat on this ol’ nail.”

“What’s that s’posed to do?” Huck asked.

“When he wakes up he’s gonna think a witch done it. I jest wish we could be round to see it.”

“Okay, it be on the nail, now let’s git,” Huck said.

Someone stirred inside the house and the boys took off running, turned the corner in a full gallop and kicked up dust. I could hear their footfalls fade.

Now someone was in the kitchen, at the door. “Jim?” It was Miss Watson.

“Yessum?”

“Was you ’sleep?”

“No, ma’am. I is a might tired, but I ain’t been ’sleep.”

“Was you in my kitchen?”

“No, ma’am.”

“Was anybody in my kitchen?”

“Not that I seen, ma’am.” That was quite actually true, as my eyes had been closed the whole time. “I ain’t seen nobody in yo kitchen.”

“Well, here’s that corn bread. You kin tell Sadie that I like her recipe. I made a couple of changes. You know, to refine it.”

“Yessum, I sho tell her.”

“You seen Huck about?” she asked.

“I seen him earlier.”

“How long ago?”

“A spell,” I said.

“Jim, I’m gonna ask you a question now. Have you been in Judge Thatcher’s library room?”

“In his what?”

“His library.”

“You mean dat room wif all dem books?”

“Yes.”

“No, missums. I seen dem books, but I ain’t been in da room. Why fo you be askin’ me dat?”

“Oh, he found some book off the shelves.”

I laughed. “What I gone do wif a book?”

She laughed, too.

**THE CORN BREAD** was wrapped in a thin towel and I had to keep shifting hands because it was hot. I considered having a taste because I was hungry, but I wanted Sadie and Elizabeth to have the first bites. When I stepped through the door, Lizzie ran to me, sniffing the air like a hound.

“What’s that I smell?” she asked.

“I imagine that would be this corn bread,” I said. “Miss Watson used your mama’s special recipe and it certainly does smell good. She did inform me that she made a couple of alterations.”

Sadie came to me and gave me a kiss on the mouth. She stroked my face. She was soft and her lips were soft, but her hands were as rough as mine from work in the fields, though still gentle.

“I’ll be sure to take this towel back to her tomorrow. White folks always remember things like that. I swear, I believe they set aside time every day to count towels and spoons and cups and such.”

“That’s the honest truth. Remember that time I forgot to put that rake back in the shed?”

Sadie had the corn bread on the block—a stump, really—that served as our table. She sliced into it. She handed portions to Lizzie and me. I took a bite and so did Lizzie. We looked at each other.

“But it smells so good,” the child said.

Sadie shaved off a sliver and put it in her mouth. “I swear that woman has a talent for not cooking.”

“Do I have to eat it?” Lizzie asked.

“No, you don’t,” Sadie said.

“But what are you going to say when she asks you about it?” I asked.

Lizzie cleared her throat. “Miss Watson, dat sum conebread lak I neva before et.”

“Try ‘dat be,’ ” I said. “That would be the correct incorrect grammar.”

“Dat be sum of conebread lak neva I et,” she said.

“Very good,” I said.

Albert appeared at the door of our shack. “James, you coming out?”

“I’ll be there directly. Sadie, do you mind?”

“Go on,” she said.

**I WALKED OUTSIDE** and over to the big fire, where the men were sitting. I was greeted and then I sat. We talked some about what happened to a runaway over at another farm. “Yeah, they beat him real good,” Doris said. Doris was a man, but that didn’t seem to matter to the slavers when they named him.

“All of them are going to hell,” Old Luke said.

“What happened to you today?” Doris asked me.

“Nothing.”

“Something must have happened,” Albert said.

They were waiting for me to tell them a story. I was apparently good at that, telling stories. “Nothing, except I got carried off to New Orleans today. Aside from that, nothing happened.”

“You what?” Albert said.

“Yes. You see, I thought I was drifting off into a nice nap about noon and the next thing I knew I was standing on a bustling street with mule-drawn carriages and whatnot all around me.”

“You’re crazy,” someone said.

I caught sight of Albert giving me the warning sign that white folks were close. Then I heard the clumsy action in the bushes and I knew it was those boys.

“Lak I say, I furst found my hat up on a nail. ‘I ain’t put dat dere,’ I say to mysef. ‘How dat hat git dere?’ And I knew ’twas witches what done it. I ain’t seen ’em, but it was dem. And one dem witches, the one what took my hat, she sent me all da way down to N’Orlins. Can you believe dat?” My change in diction alerted the rest to the white boys’ presence. So, my performance for the boys became a frame for my story. My story became less of a tale as the real game became the display for the boys.

“You don’t says,” Doris said. “Dem witches ain’t to be messed wif.”

“You got dat right,” another man said.

We could hear the boys giggling. “So, dere I was in N’Orlins and guess what?” I said. “All of a sudden dis root doctor come up behind me. He say, ‘Whatchu doin’ in dis here town.’ I tells him I ain’t got no idea how I git dere. And you know what he say ta me? You know what he say?”

“What he say, Jim?” Albert asked.

“He say I, Jim, be a free man. He say dat ain’t nobody gone call me no nigga eber ’gin.”

“Lawd, hab mercy,” Skinny, the farrier, shouted out.

“Demon say I could buy me what I want up da street. He say I could have me some whisky, if’n I wanted. Whatchu think ’bout that?”

“Whisky is the devil’s drink,” Doris said.

“Din’t matter,” I said. “Din’t matter a bit. He say I could hab it if’n I wanted it. Anything else, too. Din’t matter, though.”

“Why was dat?” a man asked.

“Furst, ’cause I was in dat place to whar dat demon sent me. Weren’t real, jest a dream. And ’cause I ain’t had me no money. It be dat simple. So dat demon snapped his old dirty fingas and sent me home.”

“Why fo he do dat?” Albert asked.

“Hell, man, you cain’t get in no trouble in N’Orlins lessen you gots some money, dream or no dream,” I said.

The men laughed. “Dat sho is what I heared,” a man said.

“Wait,” I said. “I thinks I hears one dem demons in the bushes right naw. Somebody gives me a torch so I kin set dis brush alight. Witches and demons don’t lak no fires burnin’ all round ’em. Dey start to melt lak butta on a griddle.”

We all laughed as we heard the white boys hightail it out of there.

**AFTER STEPPING ON** them squeaking boards last night, I knew Miss Watson would have me nailing down those planks and fixing that loose step. I waited till midmorning so I wouldn’t wake any white folks. They could sleep like nobody’s business and always complained to wake up too early, no matter how late it was.

Huck came out of the house and watched me for a few minutes. He hovered around like he did when something was on his mind.

“Why you ain’t out runnin’ wif yo friend?” I asked.

“You mean Tom Sawyer?”

“I guessin’ dat da one.”

“He’s probably still sleepin’. He was probably up all night robbin’ banks and trains and such.”

“He do dat, do he?”

“Claims to. He got some money, so he buys himself books and be readin’ all the time ’bout adventures. Sometimes I ain’t so sho ’bout him.”

“Whatchu mean?”

“Like, he found this cave and we goes into it and have a meeting with some other boys, but we get in there it’s like he gotta be the boss.”

“Yeah?”

“And all because he been reading them books.”

“And dat sorta rub you da wrong way?” I asked.

“Why people say that? ‘Rubbing the wrong way’?”

“Well, the way I sees it, Huck, is if’n you rake a fish’s back wid a fork head ta tail, ain’t gone matter much to him, but if’n you go ta other way…”

“I git it.”

“It seem sumtimes you jest gotta put up wif your friends. Dey gonna do what dey gonna do.”

“Jim, you work the mules and you fix the wagon wheels and now you fixin’ this here porch. Who taught you to do all them things?”

I stopped and looked at the hammer in my hand, flipped it. “Dat be a good question, Huck.”

“So, who did?”

“Necessity.”

“What?”

“ ’Cessity,” I corrected myself. “ ’Cessity is when you gots to do sumptin’ or else.”

“Or else what?”

“Else’n they takes you to the post and whips ya or they drags ya down to the river and sells ya. Nuffin you gots to worry ’bout.”

Huck looked at the sky. He pondered on that a bit. “Sho is pretty when you jest look at the sky with nothin’ in it, jest blue. I heard tell there are names for different blues. And reds and the like. I wonder what you call that blue.”

“ ‘Robin’s egg,’ ” I said. “You ever seen a robin’s egg?”

“You right, Jim. It is like a robin’s egg, ’ceptin’ it ain’t got the speckles.”

I nodded. “Dat be why you gots to look past the speckles.”

“Robin’s egg,” Huck said, again.

We sat there a little longer. “What else be eatin’ you?” I asked.

“I think Miss Watson is crazy.”

I didn’t say anything.

“Always talkin’ ’bout Jesus and prayers and such. She got Jesus Christ on the brain. She told me that prayers is to help me act selflessly in the world. What the hell does that mean?”

“Don’t be swearin’ naw, Huck.”

“You sound like her. I don’t see no profit in askin’ for stuff just so I don’t get it and learn a lesson ’bout not gettin’ what I asked fer. What kinda sense does that make? Might as well pray to that board there.”

I nodded.

“You noddin’ that it makes sense or don’t make no sense?”

“I’m jest noddin’, Huck.”

“I’m surrounded by crazy people. You know what Tom Sawyer did?”

“Tells me, Huck.”

“He made us take an oath in blood that if’n any of us tells gang secrets, then we will kill that person’s entire family. Don’t that sound crazy?”

“How you take a blood oath?” I asked.

“You’re supposed to cut yer hand open with a knife and shake with everybody else what done the same thing. You know, so your blood gets all mixed and mashed together. Then you’re blood brothers.”

I looked at his hands.

“We used spit instead. Tom Sawyer said it would do the same thing and how could we rob a bank wif our hands all cut up. One boy cried and said he was going to tell and Tom Sawyer shut him up wif a nickel.”

“Ain’t you tellin’ me yo secrets right naw?” I asked.

Huck paused. “You’re different.”

“ ’Cause I’m a slave?”

“No, taint that.”

“What it is, den?”

“You’re my friend, Jim.”

“Why, thank ya, Huck.”

“You won’t tell nobody, will ya?” He stared anxiously at me. “Even if we go out and rob us a bank. You won’t tell, right?”

“I kin keep me a secret, Huck. I kin keep yo secret, too.”

Miss Watson came to the back screen and hissed, “Ain’t you done with that step yet, Jim?”

“Matter fact, I am, Miss Watson,” I said.

“It’s a miracle with this here boy yakking your ear off. Huckleberry, you get back in this house and make yer bed.”

“I’m jest gonna mess it up agin tonight,” Huck said. He shoved his hands in his britches and swayed there, like he knew he’d just crossed a line.

“Don’t make me come out there,” she said.

“See ya later, Jim.” Huck ran into the house, running by Miss Watson sideways like he was dodging a swat.

“Jim,” Miss Watson said, looking back into the house after Huck.

“Ma’am?”

“I hear tell Huck’s pappy is back in town.” She stepped past me and looked at the road.

I nodded. “Yessum.”

“Keep an eye on Huck,” she said.

I didn’t know exactly what she was asking me to do. “Yessum.” I put the hammer back in the box. “Ma’am, what I s’posed to keep my eye on, zackly?”

“And help him watch out for that Sawyer boy.”

“Why fo you tellin’ me all dis, missum?”

The old woman looked at me and then out at the road and then up at the sky. “I don’t know, Jim.”

I studied on Miss Watson’s words. That Tom Sawyer wasn’t really a danger to Huck, just a kind of little fellow sitting on his shoulder whispering nonsense. But his father being back, that was a different story. That man might have been sober or he might have been drunk, but in either of those conditions he consistently threw beatings onto the poor boy.

## Chapter 2


T**HAT EVENING** I sat down with Lizzie and six other children in our cabin and gave a language lesson. These were indispensable. Safe movement through the world depended on mastery of language, fluency. The young ones sat on the packed-dirt floor and I was on one of our two homemade stools. The hole in the roof pulled the smoke from the fire that burned in the middle of the shack.

“Papa, why do we have to learn this?”

“White folks expect us to sound a certain way and it can only help if we don’t disappoint them,” I said. “The only ones who suffer when they are made to feel inferior is us. Perhaps I should say ‘when they don’t feel superior.’ So, let’s pause to review some of the basics.”

“Don’t make eye contact,” a boy said.

“Right, Virgil.”

“Never speak first,” a girl said.

“That’s correct, February,” I said.

Lizzie looked at the other children and then back to me. “Never address any subject directly when talking to another slave,” she said.

“What do we call that?” I asked.

Together they said, “Signifying.”

“Excellent.” They were happy with themselves, and I let that feeling linger. “Let’s try some situational translations. Something extreme first. You’re walking down the street and you see that Mrs. Holiday’s kitchen is on fire. She’s standing in her yard, her back to her house, unaware. How do you tell her?”

“Fire, fire,” January said.

“Direct. And that’s almost correct,” I said.

The youngest of them, lean and tall five-year-old Rachel, said, “Lawdy, missum\! Looky dere.”

“Perfect,” I said. “Why is that correct?”

Lizzie raised her hand. “Because we must let the whites be the ones who name the trouble.”

“And why is that?” I asked.

February said, “Because they need to know everything before us. Because they need to name everything.”

“Good, good. You all are really sharp today. Okay, let’s imagine now that it’s a grease fire. She’s left bacon unattended on the stove. Mrs. Holiday is about to throw water on it. What do you say? Rachel?”

Rachel paused. “Missums, that water gone make it wurs\!”

“Of course, that’s true, but what’s the problem with that?”

Virgil said, “You’re telling her she’s doing the wrong thing.”

I nodded. “So, what should you say?”

Lizzie looked at the ceiling and spoke while thinking it through. “Would you like for me to get some sand?”

“Correct approach, but you didn’t translate it.”

She nodded. “Oh, Lawd, missums ma’am, you wan fo me to gets some sand?”

“Good.”

“ ‘Gets some’ is hard to say.” This from Glory, the oldest child. “The *s*’s.”

“That’s true,” I said. “And it’s okay to trip over it. In fact, it’s good. You wan fo me to ge-gets s-s-some s-sand, Missum Holiday?”

“What if they don’t understand?” Lizzie asked.

“That’s okay. Let them work to understand you. Mumble sometimes so they can have the satisfaction of telling you not to mumble. They enjoy the correction and thinking you’re stupid. Remember, the more they choose to not want to listen, the more we can say to one another around them.”

“Why did God set it up like this?” Rachel asked. “With them as masters and us as slaves?”

“There is no God, child. There’s religion but there’s no God of theirs. Their religion tells that we will get our reward in the end. However, it apparently doesn’t say anything about their punishment. But when we’re around them, we believe in God. Oh, Lawdy Lawd, we’s be believin’. Religion is just a controlling tool they employ and adhere to when convenient.”

“There must be something,” Virgil said.

“I’m sorry, Virgil. You might be right. There might be some higher power, children, but it’s not their white God. However, the more you talk about God and Jesus and heaven and hell, the better they feel.”

The children said together, “And the better they feel, the safer we are.”

“February, translate that.”

“Da mo’ betta dey feels, da mo’ safer we be.”

“Nice.”

**HUCK CAUGHT ME** as I was hauling sacks of chicken feed from the buckboard to the shed in the back of the Widow Douglas’s house. He was studying on something intently and I could tell he wanted to talk.

“What be on yo mind, Huck?”

“Prayers,” he said. “Do you pray?”

“Yessir, I prays all the time.”

“What do you pray fer?” he asked.

“I prays for all sorta things. I pray once that the lil’ girl February would get better when she be sick.”

“Did it work?”

“Well, she be better now.” I sat on the buckboard and looked at the sky. “I pray fer rain once.”

“Did it work that time?”

“It did rain, sho nuff. Not right away, but ’ventually.”

“Then how you know God done it?”

“Reckon I don’t. But don’t God do everything? Who else make it rain?”

Huck picked up a rock, studied it in his hand for a bit, then hurled it at a squirrel high on an elm branch.

“Wanna know what I thinks?”

Huck looked at me.

“I thinks praying is for the people round you what wants you to pray. Pray so Miss Watson and Widow Douglas hears you and ask Jesus for what you knows dey wants. Make yer life a sight easier.”

“Maybe.”

“Ever’ now and den toss in something like a new fishin’ pole or like dat so they can scold you.”

Huck nodded. “That makes sense. Jim, you believe in God?”

“Why, sho nuff I does. If dere ain’t no God, den how we get this here wonderful life? Naw, you run on and play.”

I watched as Huck ran on down the street and turned out of sight around the corner in front of Judge Thatcher’s big house. Old Luke came up behind me as I was about to hoist the last sack up on my shoulder.

“You startled me,” I said.

“Sorry about that.” He hopped up and sat his short body on the wagon bed. “What did that little peckerhead want?”

“That boy’s all right,” I said. “He’s just trying to figure things out. Like the rest of us, I guess.”

“Have you heard about that McIntosh brother down in St. Louis?”

I shook my head.

“Free man. Light like you. He got himself into a scuffle at the docks and the police came and got him. He asked what they were going to do to him for fighting. One of the police said they were probably going to hang him. The brother believed him. Why wouldn’t he? He pulled out his knife and cut them both.”

A white man walked up and for some reason studied the horse hitched to the wagon. Luke stopped talking. We tried to not make eye contact with the man. We had been talking, so we had to keep talking.

“Go on,” I said to Luke.

“Okee. So, blue gum monkey on up da alley jes lak Lucifer done bit on da broomstick. And dem charlies be down on him like white on rice. I means dey be on ’em lak dem bubbles on soap.”

I nodded.

“Hey,” the white man shouted.

“Suh?” I said.

“This here horse belong to Miss Watson?”

“Naw, suh. The buckboard be belonging to Miss Watson. Da horse be dat of Wida Douglas.”

“You think she wanna sell him?”

“I wouldn’t know dat, suh.”

“You ask her when you see her,” he said.

“Yessuh, I sho will.”

The man looked at the horse one more time, spread the animal’s lips with his fingers and then walked away.

“What do you suppose a fool like that wants with a horse? He doesn’t know anything about horses,” Luke said.

“This creature is hundred years old and can barely pull this wagon when it’s dry and empty.”

“White people love to buy stuff,” Luke said.

“So, what happened to McIntosh?” I asked.

“They caught up to him and chained him to an oak tree, piled sticks under him and burned him alive. I heard he screamed for somebody to shoot him. Men yelled they’d shoot the first person who tried to save him from his misery.”

I felt sick to my stomach, but it wasn’t so different from many stories I’d heard. Still the day felt hotter and I realized how sticky with sweat I was. “A terrible way to die,” I said.

“I suppose there’s no good way,” Luke said.

“I don’t know about that.”

“What do you mean?” Luke asked.

“I mean, we are going to die. Maybe all ways to die aren’t bad. Maybe there’s a way to die that will satisfy me.”

“You’re talking crazy.”

I laughed.

Luke shook his head. “That wasn’t the worst part. Colored people die every day; you know that. The worst part was that the judge told the grand jury that it was an act of a multitude and so they couldn’t recommend any indictments. So, if enough people do it, it’s not a crime.”

“Good Lord,” I said. “Slavery.”

“Got that right,” Luke said. “If enough of them kill you, they’re innocent. Guess what the judge’s name was.”

I waited.

“ ‘Lawless.’ ”

“Do you think we’ll ever get to go to someplace like St. Louis or New Orleans?” I asked him.

“When we’s gets to heaben,” he said and winked.

We started to laugh and then we spotted a white man up the road. There was nothing that irritated white men more than a couple of slaves laughing. I suspected they were afraid we were laughing at them or else they simply hated the idea of us having a good time. Whatever the case, we were slow to hush and so captured his attention. He’d heard us and walked our way.

“What you boys gigglin’ like little girls ’bout?” he asked.

I’d seen the man before, but I didn’t know him. He tried to strike a pose like a dangerous man. That made me more and less afraid of him.

“We was wonderin’ if’n it be true?” Luke said.

“What be true?” the man asked.

“We be’s wonderin’ if’n dem streets in New Orleans really is made a gol, lak dey say,” Luke said and looked at me.

“And if’n it be true dat when it flood, it flood da streets with whisky. I ain’t never tasted no whisky, nosuh, but it sho nuff look good.” I turned to Luke. “Don’t it look good ta you, Luke?”

It was at this point that I imagined, for a second, that he saw we were making fun of him, but he laughed big and said, “It looks good ’cause it is good, boys.” He walked away howling.

“He’s going to get drunk now, not so much because he can, but because we can’t,” I said.

Luke chuckled. “So, when we see him staggering around later acting the fool, will that be an example of proleptic irony or dramatic irony?”

“Could be both.”

“Now that would be ironic.”

## Chapter 3


T**HE SPRING SNOW** caught everybody by surprise. Miss Watson had me chopping wood all day, so that she could have enough for weeks. But there wasn’t much and she wasn’t suggesting that I or any other slave might take some home. We collected what we could from the ground and secretly felled some small trees near the quarters. That wood was, of course, green and smoked terribly and was hard to keep going, but it gave some heat. I managed to stash some seasoned logs under Miss Watson’s porch. I would return for them in the night. The old slaves April and Cotton needed them. Some folks might have called what I was doing stealing. So would I, and I didn’t particularly care. I had worked up a sweat and had my shirt off, even though it was cold.

“That’s a lot of wood,” Huck said. He startled me. “Did I scare you?” he asked.

“A lil’ bit, I s’pose. Where you comin’ from?”

“I just sold all my worldly possessions to Judge Thatcher. He give me this here dollar fer all of it.”

I whistled. “A whole dollar. I din’t know you had so much.”

I split some more wood and caught Huck staring at me.

“How you be lakin’ school?”

“I reckon you kin say I’m getting used to it.”

“I wouldn’t mind me sum learnin’.” I split a couple more logs.

“You know, you ain’t much darker ’n me.”

“I be dark nuff.”

“How come you’re a slave?”

“ ’Cause my mama was one.”

“What about your pa?” he asked.

“Prolly not. But it don’ matter. If’n dey know one o’ yo kin colored, den you colored. Don’ matter what you looks lak.”

“I seen some tracks in the snow,” Huck said.

“I s’pect dere be lotta tracks in da snow. Dat be where folks leaves ’em.”

“One of them tracks had a cross in the heel.”

“Whatchu mean, cross?”

“You know, like Jesus—that kinda cross.”

“I wouldn’t study on dat too much,” I said. I didn’t like seeing the boy troubled like that. I knew what he was thinking.

“So, you think it’s him, too.” He was talking about his father. “You think he’s back, too.”

“I din’t say dat.”

“But you thought it. I could tell that you thought it. What does he want, Jim? You know stuff.”

I reached into my pocket and pulled out a ball of hair from a mule’s tail that I always saved for those white children. “You know what dis here be?” I held it up so that the sunlight caught it.

“What?”

“It be a hairball from da belly of an ox. You know what dat make it?”

The boy shook his head. “Magic,” I told him. “Dis here hairball be magic and it can talk ta me.”

“What does it say?”

I put the ball up to my ear. “Yeah, I hears it. It be talkin’. It say your pappy gots two angels what folla him round in dis world, one dem black and da other one white. They be telling him different things. One be bad and one be good and da man don’ know what one will win out. He don’ know what he gwyne to do. Leave or stay. This here ball s’posed to know, but it don’t.”

“That don’t help none.”

“Wait, da ball talkin’ ’gin.”

Huck tried to listen with me.

“Yeah, yeah. It say you gone be awright. You gonna git hurt and den you gonna be awright. Dere be two womens hangin’ round you. You gonna marry yersef a poor woman and den a rich ’un. But whateber you does, stay way from da water. That riber be da death of you.”

“It say all that?”

I nodded. “It be sleepin’ naw.”

Miss Watson came to the door. “Huck,” she called, “get in here and wash up for supper.” She looked at me. “Boy, ain’t you done with that wood yet?”

“Be a mess of it, missums.”

“Well, stop now ’cause it’s too loud. My head hurts.”

“Yessum.”

* * *

**LUKE CAUGHT UP** to me as I was walking home. “Slow down so an old man can keep up,” he said.

We walked quietly for a while. I knew I was being extra quiet, but I couldn’t help it. I kicked at a rock.

“What are you fretting over?” Luke asked.

“Nothing,” I said.

“Are you worried about the logs you stashed under the porch?”

“You saw those?”

“I did.”

“No, I’m not worried about the wood.”

“You worried about that boy,” Luke said. When I looked at him, he said, “Huck. That boy, Huck.”

“Well, he’s got a drunkard father that won’t leave him alone.”

“What’s that to you? That’s white people’s business.”

I nodded. “He’s still a child.”

“Yeah, a free child.” He pointed at me. “There is something about that boy. Something about you and him.”

“He’s got a heap of trouble,” I said. “Sad as that may be, I’m still a slave and I can’t help him at all.”

## Chapter 4


T**HE WEATHER REMAINED** unseasonably cold and I found myself pilfering wood for not only April and Cotton, but also my family and a couple of others. I was terribly concerned that the wood might be missed, and that fear worked its way into reality one Sunday afternoon. Sadie came to me.

“What’s the matter?” I asked.

She peeked out the shack door, looked at the nine-year-old and then at me. “What are you going to do?” she asked.

“What are you talking about?”

“I heard Miss Watson talking to Judge Thatcher.”

“Yes?”

Sadie sniffed.

I put my arm around her. “Settle down.”

Nothing could have prepared me for what she said next. She said, “Miss Watson told Judge Thatcher that she was going to sell you to a man in New Orleans.”

“What’s that mean?” Lizzie asked. “Papa, what does that mean?”

I walked to the door and looked out.

“Jim?” Sadie said.

“Papa?”

“Did she say all of us or only me?” I asked.

“Just you, Jim,” she cried. “What are we going to do? They’re going to split us up and we won’t know where you are.”

“What?” Lizzie gasped.

“No, they’re not,” I said. I grabbed a big rag and laid it out.

“What are you doing?” Sadie asked.

I put bread and dried meat on the cloth and folded it up. “They can’t sell me if they don’t have me.”

“You can’t run,” Sadie said. “You know what they do to runaways.”

“I’ll hide out. I’ll hide out on Jackson Island. They’ll think I’ve run north, but I’ll be here. Then I’ll figure out something.”

“You can’t do that. They’ll find you for sure. Then they’ll treat you like a runaway. They might even—” She stopped.

“Even what?” Lizzie asked.

“Well, I’m going to go out there until I can figure out what to do,” I said. I took a knee and looked at Lizzie, held her tight. “Listen, everything is going to be all right. Okay, do you hear me, sweetie?”

She cried.

I stood and kissed Sadie. “Don’t tell anyone where I’ve gone. You can’t even tell Luke.”

“Okay.”

“Did you hear that, Lizzie?” I said.

“Yes, Papa.”

I moved toward the door.

“Papa?”

“I’m okay, baby.” I felt Sadie’s hand land on my shoulder. I kissed her. “I’ll come back for you.”

I left my family and slipped into the woods. It was perhaps stupid to attempt escape during the light of day, but I didn’t know when they might come for me. I didn’t run. Running was something a slave could never do, unless, of course, he was running. No one noticed as I passed through the Widow Douglas’s backyard and down the steep hill to the river. I waited there against an undercut bank. I couldn’t venture out onto the water during the day. Too many ferries and riverboats and folks fishing along the shore. I was as much scared as angry, but where does a slave put anger? We could be angry with one another; we were human. But the real source of our rage had to go without address, swallowed, repressed. They were going to rip my family apart and send me to New Orleans, where I would be even farther from freedom and would probably never see my family again.

* * *

—

**AT DUSK** I was eaten alive by mosquitoes. I pulled a log from the bank and slid it into the frigid, muddy water. I pushed off and kicked my way straight across, knowing that the strong current of the Mississippi would suck me downstream. I could just barely see the island in the dark and I hoped I wouldn’t glide right past it. Luckily, no riverboats ever navigated the channel between the shore and the island. But I couldn’t be sure some peckerwood wouldn’t paddle by in a canoe or on a raft.

I could finally see the island, but I felt a tugging on my leg. I couldn’t shake loose of the snag. I didn’t believe in river monsters, so I quickly figured I’d gotten hung up in somebody’s trotline. Getting untangled was difficult, and for a brief time I thought I was going to miss the island or drown or both. It, however, turned out to be good fortune. When I yanked the line free of its tether, I pulled with it three large catfish that I could eat that night, which was good because my bread was ruined. Also, I could reuse the line and the hooks. This thinking was good because it distracted me from just how exhausted I was. I hit the rocky beach of the island and lay on my back, the fish on my chest. It was the fish smell that woke me. As my exhaustion wore off, I began to shiver uncontrollably. I was freezing, but there was nothing I could do about that. I wrestled out of my soaked rag of a coat and my clothes. I took my little knife from my pocket and gutted the catch. I cut off the heads and discarded them because I could not stomach their faces. I couldn’t risk a fire in the darkness. I would cook them and eat in the morning. I had to get myself dry and warm and find some sleep. I moved into the trees, out of the wind, and buried myself in fallen leaves. I put my wet coat on top of the plant matter and closed my eyes. The weight of the garment at least made me imagine that I was warmer.

* * *

—

**MORNING CAME AND I** crawled into my drier, but frozen, clothes. The coat was still wet, so I laid it over a bush. I hopped around to get warm, waiting for the sun to get high enough for me to use my piece of glass to start a fire. I heard rustling in the trees. It sounded like a human, so I had to assume it was a white human.

“What dere be in dem woods? Dat be a ghost? You stays away from me, you ol’ shade.”

“Jim? Is that you, Jim?” It was Huck.

“I swear, you lak to scared me to def.”

“What you doin’ out here?” the boy asked.

“Furst off, I’m freezin’,” I said. “What you be doin’ on dis ilan? And why you got blood all ova ya?”

“I kilt myself,” the boy said.

I looked him over. “You din’t do a good job.”

“Well, Miss Watson, that damn judge and Pap think I’m dead and that’s all that matters. They think I was murdered.”

“Why dey think dat?” I asked.

“I kilt a pig and spread his blood all round Pap’s cabin. I made a mess like there had been a fight in there.”

In my head I was doing the math. Huck was supposedly murdered and I’d just run away. Who did I think they would suspect of the heinous crime?

“But what you doin’ out here, Jim?”

“I be hidin’.”

“Why?”

“Well, I be hidin’ causin’ Miss Watson got a notion to sell me down the riber. And now…” I shook my head.

“And now what?”

“And now causin’ I kilt you. Least dat what dey gone think.” I looked at his eyes. “You needs to go back.”

“I cain’t,” Huck said. “Pap will kill me for sure.”

“I reckon dat’s tru nuff.” I looked through the trees at the channel we’d crossed. “Lawd, hab mercy.”

“What’s your plan, Jim?”

“I was gonna live out heah on dis here ilan for a spell, but naw dey lookin’ fer a killa and a body.”

“What you mean, Miss Watson gonna sell you down the river?”

“I be a slave, Huck. She kin sell me if she want. And ’parently, she want. I had to run fo’ she done it.”

“But you got a family.”

“Don’ mean nuffin if’n you a slave.”

Huck sat and studied on that.

The sun was up and slicing the trees, burning off a bit of the chill. I pointed to the catfish. “Leaseways we got breakfast,” I said. “You got matches?”

“No.”

“Den I use my magic glass,” I said. I took the round bottom of some bottle I’d found a long time ago from my pocket.

“Magic?”

“Magic,” I repeated. “It take light from da sun and mixes it round and gits all narrow and turns inta fire.”

I moved us to a small clearing and used the glass and got some kindling of dry moss started and let the boy add sticks. A couple of logs later and we had it going nicely. The fire felt good. It probably was a bad idea, but we didn’t peel the skin off the last fish.

“I got some bread,” Huck said.

“I lost mine in da water. I figger my jerky gone dry out okay.” I looked at the fish. “I reckon dat skin gone burn ’way, awright.”

“Pap jest eats the skin.”

“Hmmm.”

I watched the smoke rise. It seemed to disperse pretty well before it reached the treetops.

Huck enjoyed the fish. “How did you catch ’em?”

“Din’t really,” I said. “I gots snagged in sumbuddy’s trotline and dey was already caught.”

“Lucky,” he said.

I nodded.

“I cain’t believe Miss Watson gone sell you. I mean, she likes you.”

“I reckon she likes money mo’. Mos’ peoples likes money mo’ ’n anythin’ else. White folks, anyways.”

“Not me,” Huck said. “I told the judge to take all that money I found.”

“How much you reckon it be?”

“Thousands,” Huck said. “Money ain’t nothing but trouble. Don’t you think, Jim?”

“I woodn’t know. Ain’t never had no money.”

Huck nodded.

We heard a boom and lay flat on the ground. We crawled to the edge of the trees and saw a ferryboat passing by. Judge Thatcher and his daughter, Bessie, were aft. Tom Sawyer’s aunt Polly was leaning over the side. A man I’d never seen was readying a small cannon to fire another shot. He lit the fuse and cracked the air with another boom. The ball splashed into the water.

“Why they doin’ that, Jim?”

“Dey’s tryin’ to get yo dead body to float up to the top o’ da water.”

“Be funny if some other body float up,” he said.

“Hilarious,” I said.

“What?” He looked at me.

“I say da ‘he harry us.’ ”

“What’s that mean?”

“What? Looky naw,” I said.

The boy turned back and we watched the man at the bow float something into the water. I was relieved to be able to redirect his attention. In all my life that was the first time I had ever had a language slip. That had to be an indication of just how addled and agitated I was.

“What’s that?” Huck asked.

“I reckon dat be a loaf a bread wif the quicksilva in it.”

“What’s that do?”

“It s’posed to find it way to a corpse.”

“Does that work?”

“White folk believe all sorts a stuff I don’t know about. Dey is the stupidstitiousest people in da world.”

“You mean ‘superstitious.’ ”

“Dat what I say.” We watched the ferryboat disappear around the bend. “They sho’ nuff thinks you dead.” As I said it, that wave of fear washed over me again. I might have been better off drowning in the river or freezing to death in the night. One thing was certain: I had to make sure Huck didn’t become the corpse they were looking for. More to the point, I had to make certain I didn’t become the corpse they were looking for.

## Chapter 5


W**E RAN A TROTLINE** across a little cove and so had plenty of catfish to eat, even the occasional crappie. We also found plenty of blackberries and gooseberries. The gooseberries were sour, but mixed with the blackberries and currants, they were quite good. The weather improved and we were living well enough that I wondered if Sadie and Lizzie and I could survive out there. But we would have to be running like fugitives, ducking and hiding. It was bad enough being a slave, but being fugitive slaves was worse. Being fugitive slaves hiding out under white people’s noses would be intolerable.

Huck seemed happy, though, feeling safe from his father. We found a big cave near the center of the island and were safe enough there to have fires at night.

“Jim,” the boy said one night, “why do you think my pappy hates me so?”

“Reckon I don’ know, Huck. Whatchu think?”

“I know he don’t like my head.”

“What?”

“Well, my hairline. He don’t like it. He’s always grabbing me and he pulls back my hair and then slaps me.”

“Hmmmph.”

“Tells me I gots a widow’s peak. I didn’t even know what that was. Miss Watson told me when I asked and she said a lot of people got ’em. It’s when yer hair points like an arrow.” He pulled back his hair and showed me. “Heck, Jim, yer head does the same thing. Pull yer hair back.”

“It do?” I touched my hair. “I reckon it do. What you s’pose a wida’s peak mean? Is it good luck?”

“Sho ain’t for me,” Huck said.

After a spell of silence, I caught Huck staring at me.

“What?” I asked.

“Being a slave, you got to do whatever your owner say to do?”

“Whateber dey say,” I said. “Wheneber dey say. Dey say, ‘Jump,’ I say, ‘How high?’ Dey say, ‘Spit,’ I say, ‘How far?’ ”

“How kin one person own another person?”

“Dat be a good question, Huck.”

“Look what I found.” Huck showed me a length of snakeskin. He pushed it toward me, but I pulled away.

“Be bad luck to handle a snakeskin,” I said. “Snake might come back lookin’ fer his clothes.”

“Who’s superstitious now?”

“Dat ain’t stupesition, dat’s jest common sense.”

Huck laughed. “What superstitions you know, Jim?”

“Don’ walk under no ladder. I know dat one. Don’ believe it.”

“So, you would walk under a ladder.”

“Nossir. Ain’t safe to walk under no ladder, but it ain’t bad luck. Black cats s’posed to be bad. White cats okay, black cats bad.”

“What if’n you see an owl in the daytime?”

I was barely listening to him. I was worried about Sadie and Lizzie. “Owl?” I said. “Daytime? Lawdy, now dat dere is some bad bizness. Dat mean sumbuddy gonna meet his maker.” I could see my answer made him happy. “But dat don’ make me stuperstitious. Dat jest mean I gots mo’ good sense, lak I say.”

Huck laughed.

“Well, one thin’ fer sho? It gone rain like crazy tomorrow, so we best to stow some food and get ready to hunkers down.”

“Why you think it’s gonna rain?”

“Seen lots of hawks flyin’ round. Dey likes to hunt fo’ it rain. And seen ants buildin’ piles round dey holes.”

“How do they know it’s gonna rain?” the boy asked.

“Dey’s a part of nature and weather be a part of nature and dem parts talk to each other.”

“Ain’t people a part of nature?”

“If’n dey is, den dey ain’t no good part. Da rest o’ nature don’ hardly talk to no human peoples anymo. Maybe it try from time to time, but peoples don’ listen. Anyway, gone be a big rain.”

I watched as exhaustion came over Huck. His head dropped and he was asleep. I went out of the cave and collected lots of wood. We were going to have to keep the fire going. There would be no sun to use to start another one. I was serious about the rain. I could feel it in my joints.

* * *

—

**MY PREDICTION WAS NOT** only true, but turned out to be grossly understated. The rain was torrential, biblical. Our beach fairly disappeared. I managed to pull in our trotline, else it would have been lost for good. That a flood was coming was a foregone conclusion. The only question was how high. The river rose and rose, covering much of Jackson Island. Sheet lightning lit up the sky seconds at a time. Huck fretted that a twister might be coming, but I told him the winds were blowing in a rotation counter to such an event. What I said was “Dat wind be twistin’ optsite of a tornada.” It was nonsense, but it quieted the boy’s fear. Then he pointed.

I looked. A house was floating down the channel toward us. It was a frightening sight. It was late afternoon, dark with no sun, and so it was difficult to see, but it was as big as what it was. It hung up against some trees and Huck and I had the same idea. Provisions. We dragged Huck’s canoe from the cave to the water and paddled to the house. It was hard work. We tied the boat to a tree and climbed in through a smashed window. We waded through water inside the wrecked house, with clothes floating everywhere. It had settled at a severe angle so it was a bit of a climb to the kitchen cabinets. Huck opened one and squealed, ironically, like a pig, as he found a rasher of bacon. I turned and saw a boot between the stove and the wall, then it became clear the boot was at the end of a leg.

“What is it?” Huck asked.

“Take the bacon and get back in the canoe,” I said.

Huck froze and stared at me.

“Does lak I say\!”

I leaned over and got a good look at the man’s face. It was a white man, deader than dead. His face was twisted and ugly and dead. I looked at the face for a while, my hands trembling not because he was dead, but because I was there while he was dead. A dead white man. I studied the face. All white men looked alike in a way, like bears, like bees, especially when dead.

“Is he dead?” Huck asked.

“Get on back in dat boat\!”

“Who is it? You recognize him?”

“I ain’t know him. Naw git. You don’t need to see nuffin lak dat.”

“I ain’t no baby, Jim.”

“You nuff o’ one—naw let’s git outta heah. Grab some dem clothes and git out dat winda.”

While he was pulling garments into his arms I found a stack of papers wedged into the corner of a shelf. There was a bottle of ink. I pushed all of it into my trousers.

As we made it through the window and were trying to pull the canoe back to us, Huck asked me why I sounded so funny in the house.

“What you be talkin’ ’bout? Git dat boat. Dis here house about to tear ’way from dem trees.”

As soon as we had paddled away, the house did just that and roared by us.

“Woooweee,” Huck said. “Look at that.”

The house was quickly out of sight.

“Was he dead, Jim?”

“Yeah, he be dead.”

“Who was he?”

I didn’t say anything. I paddled us into the trees, and then we climbed out onto muddy ground.

“Who was he, Jim? I ain’t never seen a dead person before.”

“I ain’t neber seed him fo’.”

Back in our cave we listened to the storm. We might have heard lightning strike a tree. The thunder shook us hard. We chewed some bacon right off the rasher. It wasn’t delicious, but the longer we chewed it, the bigger it got, and so it satisfied our hunger.

“I wonder who he was,” Huck said.

“It be bad luck to study on dead folk,” I told him. “You already stackin’ dat bad luck after handlin’ dat snakeskin.”

“This bacon is awful,” Huck said.

“Sho nuff,” I said.

But we kept chewing.

“You heard the one ’bout not putting mirrors facing mirrors?” Huck asked. I looked at his young eyes and thought about Lizzie. I wondered just how scared she was for me at that moment, hated the idea of her feeling fear. I realized I hated it because I knew that feeling so well, every day, every night. I laughed to myself and I didn’t know why.

“What is it?” the boy asked.

I couldn’t use the word *irony* with him. “Sho be funny, ain’t it?”

“What?”

“Here we is chewin’ on dis terrbul bacon, me a runaway and you a dead boy. You know dey gone think I da one dat kilt you.”

“I never thought of that,” Huck said. “I never dreamed I could git you into trouble. Why would you want to kill me?”

“Dat don’t matter none to white folks.”

“I don’t like white folks,” he said. “And I is one.”

“Sho look lak one.”

Lightning lit up the outside at the cave’s mouth and then thunder shook us again. The storm was right on top of us. I had been right about the weather, but I hadn’t thought far enough ahead to remember that we might not be the only ones on the island trying to find a dry place. I reached back for another stick for the fire without looking and felt pain shoot through my hand. I screamed and jumped up.

“Jim,” Huck shouted.

The rattlesnake that had been attached to my hand fell off into the fire, but it managed to wriggle free across the ground and out into the rain.

“Did he get you?”

“ ’Fraid so.” I walked over to the mouth of the cave and dropped to my knees. I took out my knife and cut the bite, gave a good suck and spat out the blood. Then I slapped some of the clay mud on it. “Git dat rag ’n’ tie it round heah.”

“What’s this gonna do?” Huck asked.

“I’s hopin’ da mud will draw out the poison. Make it tight.”

“Do you think it will work?”

“At least one of us gone know in da moanin’.”

## Chapter 6


M**Y FACE FELT FAT** and numb and my hands and feet were without feeling, but where I was bitten was extremely painful. I felt weaker than I’d ever felt. If I had had any real food in me I might have vomited. My head was spinning, the world was spinning, and I didn’t know if it was from the venom or from anxiety. I lay still, at first feeling the concerned stare of Huck, and then a spiraling into delirium, like down a whirlpool. I burned with fever, and the chills I was feeling were almost interesting. I saw Sadie and Lizzie. They stood on a little wooden dock, took vegetables from a little boat and piled them in big straw baskets. Then I was in Judge Thatcher’s library, a place where I had spent many afternoons while he was out at work or hunting ducks. I could see books in front of me. I had read them secretly, but this time, in this fever dream, I was able to read without fear of being discovered. I had wondered every time I sneaked in there what white people would do to a slave who had learned how to read. What would they do to a slave who had taught the other slaves to read? What would they do to a slave who knew what a hypotenuse was, what *irony* meant, how *retribution* was spelled? I was burning up with fever, fading in and out of consciousness, focusing and refocusing on Huck’s face.

François-Marie Arouet de Voltaire put a fat stick into the fire. His delicate fingers held the wood for what seemed like too long a time.

“I’m afraid there’s no more wood,” I said. “Which is fine, because I am hot enough. Too hot.”

He reached in again and moved some charred pieces around. He looked at his blackened fingertips. “I’m like you,” he said.

“How is that?”

He wiped his hands on his pants, left smudges. “You shouldn’t be a slave,” Voltaire said, sighing. He sat beside me, moved to feel my forehead with the back of his hand and then thought better. “Like Montesquieu, I think we are all equal, regardless of color, language or habit.”

“You do, do you?” I asked.

“However, you must realize that climate and geography can be significant factors in determining human development. It’s not that your features make you unequal, it’s that they are signs of biological differences, things that have helped you survive in those hot, desolate places. It’s those factors that stop you from achieving the more perfect human form found in Europe.”

“Is that right?”

“The African can be easily trained in the ways of the European, of course. He can come to be more than he naturally is, to learn those manners and skills that will allow him to become equal.”

“Yes?”

“That is what equality is, Jim. It’s the *capacity* for becoming equal. The same way a black man in Martinique can learn French and so become French, he can also acquire the skills of equality and so become equal. But I repeat myself.”

“I hate you,” I said through my fever and chills. “You realize, of course, that I have been bitten by a snake. Only to have you come to me in this delirium.”

“Well, yes, but all men are equal. That’s my point. But even you have to admit the presence of, shall we call him—it—the devil, in your African humans.” Voltaire adjusted his position and held his hands to the fire.

“You’re saying we’re equal, but also inferior,” I said.

“I’m detecting a disapproving tone,” he said. “Listen, my friend, I’m on your side. I’m against the institution of slavery. Slavery of any kind. You know that I am an abolitionist of the first order.”

“Thank you?”

“You’re welcome.”

“You do not believe that humans are inherently bad?” I asked.

“I do not. If they were, they would kill as soon as they could walk.”

“How do you explain slavery? Why are my people subjected to it, treated with such cruelty?”

Voltaire shrugged.

“Let me try this,” I said. “You have a notion, like Raynal, of natural liberties, and we all have them by virtue of our being human. But when those liberties are put under societal and cultural pressure, they become civil liberties, and those are contingent on hierarchy and situation. Am I close?”

Voltaire was scribbling on paper. “That was good, that was good. Say all of that again.”

“Jim? Jim?” It was Huck.

“Huckleberry?”

“You okay?”

The boy came into some focus. “I ain’t as hot as I was.” I glimpsed the mouth of the cave and saw daylight. “I guess Ima gone make it.”

“You sho talk funny in yer sleep.”

“I does?”

Huck nodded. He looked at me suspiciously.

“What I say?”

“Who is Raynal?”

I recalled some of my dream, wondered just how much talking I had done out loud. “He be a slave I knowed from way back.”

“What does *hierarchy *mean?”

“What?” I said. “Ain’t no such word.”

“You said it. And a lotta other words. You didn’t sound like you. Are you possessed, Jim?”

“Lawdy. I could be, I s’pose. Wouldn’t dat be sumptin’. A snake is da devil, ain’t he. I hopes he din’t put no demons in my blood.” I looked around the cave. “Where my lucky piece o’ glass.” I found the round glass and held it so the boy could see it. “My lucky glass will protect me.”

I was still weak and I used fondling the glass as an excuse to get away from Huck’s questions.

“You was sho talkin’ funny.”

“I’m habing dem chills ’gin.” And in fact I was.

“Here, drink some water.” Huck handed me the old can we’d been using for drinking.

“Thank ya, Huck.”

“I’ll go see if the storm ruined all the berries.”

“You do dat. Ima gonna sleep sum mo’. Watch out for dem snakes.”

As the boy disappeared into the bright light of the outside, I felt again how sick I was. I suspected at that moment that I would not die, but it was unclear whether I would be pleased about that fact. My head was swimming and I was in great pain. I was nauseated and still feverish. I tried to pull myself to my feet, but my limbs were numb and uncooperative. In truth, I was afraid to sleep again for fear of Huck coming back and hearing my thoughts without their passing through my slave filter. I was even more afraid of further unproductive, imagined conversations with Voltaire, Rousseau and Locke about slavery, race and, of all things, albinism. How strange a world, how strange an existence, that one’s equal must argue for one’s equality, that one’s equal must hold a station that allows airing of that argument, that one cannot make that argument for oneself, that premises of said argument must be vetted by those equals who do not agree.

My chills returned and I thought again that I might die. I broke into a sweat and lay still for another couple of hours until Huck returned.

“Jim, you okay?”

“I’s been betta.”

“I found some blackberries what weren’t ruined,” he said and unfolded a cloth to show me. “I put our trotline out, so we should have some fish tonight.”

“How big dat flood? Water go down?”

“Not that I kin see,” the boy said. “We’re a long way from the land now.”

“Water might be movin’ too fast to catch us dem catfish.”

“You look a lil’ better,” Huck said. He stirred the fire and put some sticks in to get it going again.

## Chapter 7


I** STAYED SICK** for a couple of days. My fever broke and slowly my appetite returned. A remarkable thing in itself, in that all we had to eat was catfish and berries. I finally ventured out to set a few traps for rabbits.

* * *

—

**AT LAST** we caught a rabbit and sat down to what felt like a real feast.

“I’m glad you didn’t die,” Huck said.

“Ima right pleased ’bout dat my own sef.” I stared into the fire. “Dyin’ can ruin a good time.”

“What is it, Jim?”

“I be worried ’bout my fambly,” I said. “I know dey be worried ’bout me. You gonna have to go see if’n dey awright.”

“I cain’t go there. I’m supposed to be dead.”

“Sho would help me some if’n you wasn’t,” I said. I looked at the clothes he’d taken in such a hurry from the washed-away house. “What if’n you wore dat dere dress and make lak you be a gurl?”

“I don’t look like no girl.”

“You would if’n you was in dat dress. You kin tie you hair back like dem white gurls does.”

“No.”

“I needs to know if’n my fambly’s okay.”

“I suppose I should find out what’s going on, too. What should my name be? My girl name.”

“Sumptin’ simple,” I said.

“What about ‘Mary’?”

“Dat a good name.”

“What about my last name? What about ‘McGillicuddy’?”

“Kin you spell it?”

Huck looked at his feet. “No.”

“Sumptin’ simple,” I said, again.

“ ‘Williams’?”

“Sho.”

Huck took his clothes off and put on the dress. His young face was effeminate enough that he might have been taken for a girl in passing. He wouldn’t bear a close look. His posture was all wrong.

“How do I look?” he asked.

“Stan’ up straight-lak and don’t hunch lak a bear.”

“Like this?”

I nodded.

“Why, I do declare,” he said in a falsetto that was actually lower than his speaking voice. “Lordy, but it’s hot in here.”

“You s’posed to be a gurl, not no ol’ woman.”

“This ain’t gone work,” the boy said.

“Sho it will.”

**THOUGH WEAK,** I helped Huck get the canoe from the cave to the river. The flood had receded considerably, but it was clear that the mainland had acquired a new contour. Because of this change it was difficult for us to know just where Huck should put ashore. We made a guess, but as Huck paddled out, it was clear that his hitting anywhere near our selected spot was hardly likely. I watched him for only a short time before I dragged myself back to the cave and the fire.

For the first time in my life, I had paper and ink. I was beside myself. I found a straight stick and shaved it to a point and scratched a groove on one side. I put the paper on my lap, dipped my stick into the ink and wrote the alphabet. I printed letters as I had seen them in books, slowly, clumsily. Then I wrote my first words. I wanted to be certain that they were mine and not some I had read from a book in the judge’s library. I wrote:
>  
> *I am called Jim. I have yet to choose a name.*

> *In the religious preachings of my white captors I am a victim of the Curse of Ham. The white so-called masters cannot embrace their cruelty and greed, but must look to that lying Dominican friar for religious justification. But I will not let this condition define me. I will not let myself, my mind, drown in fear and outrage. I will be outraged as a matter of course. But my interest is in how these marks that I am scratching on this page can mean anything at all. If they can have meaning, then life can have meaning, then I can have meaning.*

## Chapter 8


I** WAS HAPPY ENOUGH** to send Huckleberry off on his mission to the mainland. My pleasure in seeing him off was threefold. If he was unsuccessful and discovered, he might be accused of having helped me escape, rather than my being seen as a runaway. And I might no longer be suspected of his murder and/or kidnapping, the punishment for either being torture and death. Finally, if Huck was able to find his way back without detection, he could bring me much desired and needed news of my family’s condition.

I was proud of the way he used all the strength in his small body to paddle against the current. The morning fog was fairly burned away as he stood on the shore. He was just barely visible as he tied the boat to a tree and covered it with brush. He scrambled up the bank in his dress and was gone. I returned to the cave, ate some dried fish and fell into a nap, during which I did not dream.

* * *

—

**I KNEW FROM EXPERIENCE** that the snake bite was not likely to kill me. My main concern was the site of the bite—the wound, not the venom. The twin punctures had scabbed over and there was no puffiness. That relief allowed me to sleep. That I could sleep so much was slightly alarming, but I continued to improve. I felt stronger every time I awoke. Strong enough to become impatient. I collected wood and kept the fire going. I collected catfish from the trotline, ate some and hung strips over the smoke to dry. I imagined that I would be running through back country, with or without Huck, for some time. I became nervous and vigilant after the second day. I pulled more tree limbs up to conceal the cave and fashioned a place to sit from which I could look out. Not that I had any idea what I might do if I spotted anyone’s approach. The boy had the canoe, so I spent some hours tying together branches, not quite a proper raft. A proper raft would need constructing near the water’s edge, and I couldn’t chance that.

I considered the notion of telling Huckleberry that the body I had seen in that flooded house was his Pap. I imagined that the knowledge might allow him to feel safe again in the house of Miss Watson. To tell the truth, I didn’t know why I had kept it to myself. Perhaps, fearful of him or not, I had some concern that grief could overcome the boy if his father, hated or not, was dead. Selfishly, I wondered how Huck’s incapacitation might affect me, but I felt only momentary guilt for that. Now that I had withheld the information for several days, Huck might become angry with me. He might betray me and cause my capture.

About dusk on the third day, I observed a column of smoke on the other side of the island. It was a terrifying sight. Maybe they were fishermen or hunters, though I was hard-pressed to know what game was there. I’d seen sign of some wild pigs, but they were plentiful on the mainland. I had seen only birds, snakes, squirrels and rabbits. I tensed and plotted which way I would run if I saw anyone, or, rather, if they saw me. I heard crunching footfalls on the forest carpet of dead leaves, and I was about to employ that route when Huck’s voice cut through the trees.

“Jim,” he called out, but not loudly.

“Here I is,” I said.

“We gotta go,” he said.

“I knows.” I pointed at the smoke.

“I made that fire. I thought some men was following me, so I built that to draw ’em off while we git.”

“Dat be good thinkin’,” I said.

“I put the canoe on the south point.”

“You sho dey comin’?”

“They was behind me, that’s all I know. I think they was followin’ me. I ain’t for certain sure.”

“Reckon we gotta leave, den. Cain’t be takin’ no chances.”

I put our food together while Huck changed out of his dress and back into his trousers and shirt. I wanted to hear his report, but I’d have to wait.

We cut through the center of the island to remain under cover. Not all of the floodwater had receded, so we found ourselves knee-deep in silty water. I had no doubt that we would be pulling leeches off each other. Huck was high-stepping because of his short legs, disturbing the water. I imagined that his splashing might ward off cottonmouths. Hoped more than imagined. We froze when we heard voices echoing through the woods. We carried our food and sparse gear over our heads.

“You best stop all dat splashin’, Huck.”

“I reckon so.”

“You know who dem is?”

“No, Jim. I don’t even know if’n they after us.”

“I sho nuff don’t wanna find out.”

We found the canoe and pushed it out into the water. We shivered, as we didn’t climb into the boat, but stayed in the water to keep a low profile. Soon we were away and in the current.

## Chapter 9


W**E CLIMBED INTO** the canoe and lay down. I asked the boy if he was okay and he said he was cold. I told him to take off his wet clothes and cover himself with the rag I’d used to pack the dried fish. I took off my shirt and tried to wring it out as much as I could.

“Did you see my fambly?” I asked.

“From a distance,” he said. “They looked awright. They looked sad.”

“What else you see? What you find out?”

Telling his story was allowing him to forget how cold and miserable he was. “First I landed on the beach, that little one just below the Stinson place, you know, where them grapes cover that fence.”

“I knows the spot.”

“Well, there was this lady in a shack. I don’t know if’n she was a Stinson or not. She was tall, near tall as you. To tell the truth, she sho looked like a man. She had big ol’ hands. I guess I got kinda wet and muddy ’cause she called me to her. She called me ‘gal.’ Kin you believe that?”

“She did?”

“But I don’t think she really believed it. She kept staring at me. But she liked to talk and she told me that folks was looking for my murderer. She didn’t say ‘my murderer,’ she said ‘Huck’s murderer.’ She said at first people blamed Pap and almost hanged him.”

“They din’t,” I said.

“No. How’d you know?”

“Guess.”

“She say then that they thought it was you what killed me.”

My heart sank.

“I kept thinkin’ that she knew it was me she was talkin’ to. Anyway, they started thinkin’ it was Pap Finn again. I guess it was because he run away from town and ain’t nobody seen him. There is a two-hundred-dollar bounty on his head.” He paused.

“What?”

“And there is a three-hundred-dollar reward for you.”

I said nothing.

“I sneaked into town to see if’n I could find Tom Sawyer. I thought maybe he could help us. But all the kids was locked inside on account of there bein’ a boy killer on the loose. At least, that’s what I figured.”

“Did ya hear anybuddy talkin’?”

“I heard the Judge Thatcher talkin’ to some feller, but they was sayin’ what I already done heard from that lady.”

“But you din’t talk to no slaves?”

He shook his head. “I slept in Miss Watson’s shed the one night. I sneaked into the kitchen and got us some candles and matches. I had some cheese, but I lost it. Then I couldn’t find the canoe. I hid out in that lady’s barn, but I had the feeling she knowed I was there. When I found the boat and set out, I spotted some men followin’ me. Least I think they was followin’ me.”

“How did my wife look?”

“Like I said, sad.”

“My baby girl?”

“Sad.”

I lay on my back and looked at the sky I couldn’t see and thought about that. I would come back for my family, I promised myself.

* * *

—

**WE MADE IT** to the shore and hid in the woods. The next morning we ate some of our food. Berries and catfish. We saved our dried fish and the biscuits Huck had stolen. Keeping an eye for boats passing on the river, we fashioned a modest raft with a lean-to cover and lashed it to our boat.

“We does our trabelin’ at night,” I told him. “We kin fish, eat and jest rest during da daytime.”

“That sounds right.” Huck turned over the fish that was cooking on the stick he held over the fire. “Can I ask you somethin’?”

“ ’Course.”

“Why you think Pap hates me?”

“*Hate* be a strong word,” I said.

“Well, what else you call it?”

“I reckon dat what you call it.”

“He hates you, too,” Huck said.

“ ’Course he hate me. I’s a slave.”

“Why he gotta hate you ’cause you’re a slave?”

“Just the way the world be, Huck.”

“Naw, he got a special hate for you.”

I nodded.

* * *

—

**DUSK CAME ON,** and with the fog we figured it was okay to set out. The Mississippi is swifter than it looks. It’s scary, for that reason. You can mess around in some branches and backwaters and start to think it’s gentle and then you get out into it and it’s a different story. Because of the recent flood we had to get pretty far from the bank or else we’d get caught up in brush or debris. That made it even more harrowing. The riverboats couldn’t see us, not that they would have steered to avoid us. And often, though they made plenty of noise, we couldn’t locate the vessels in the fog until they were very near. Their wakes rocked us crazily, more so because our shelter had made us top-heavy and lopsided. We spent much time baling water with the only two small cans we had. The work was exhausting.

The fog lifted and we could see the lanterns of the riverboats across the river. We saw Fourmile Island. It looked like it went on forever, and I realized just how far away my family was from me. Then Huck screamed and I looked back to see a huge riverboat right up on us. There must have been a problem with its engines because it made no sound. We paddled toward the shore as hard as we could. I could feel the draw of the water on us.

“Fasta, Huck\! You gots to dig in\!”

“I’m workin’\!” he cried.

We listed precariously toward the boat and then, as if the ship had a mind to let us go, we righted. I looked at Huck and he, too, knew what was coming. The wake. We grabbed on to our little craft the best we could, not just to keep it from capsizing, but to hold it together. The wake hit us, a wall of water. We lost some of our shelter. The wave soaked us through and we rocked violently. Holding on with one hand, we baled with abandon.

“You believe in Jesus?” Huck screamed.

“Sho,” I said. “But maybe you be the one to ax him fo help? He don’t seem to pay no mind to the wishes of no slave.”

The ship gone, we continued to bale. We rocked less violently.

“Did ya pray to da Lawd?” I asked.

“Never got a chance to,” Huck said. “We made it anyway.”

“I reckon we did.”

## Chapter 10


W**E MADE OUR WAY** downriver for a few days. Once we had drifted past Saverton, there wasn’t much to see. Still, we traveled by night and foraged during the day. We trolled a line a couple of times, but Huck nearly pulled a cottonmouth into the boat once, so we gave that up. The river split and narrowed and we determined that we could travel some by day. That plan was short-lived. We came back to the wide channel and saw some men pointing at us from the deck of a small riverboat. That scared us back into the dark.

One night, our fire burning, Huck asked, “Why don’t you just make me take you across that river? In Illinois you be a free man.”

I had thought of it, but somehow it just seemed like I’d be that much farther from family. Slavery didn’t recognize imaginary borders. I needed money. “I thinked on it, Huck. But you and me be friends. I cain’t just leave you.” And I meant that. Huck was just a boy.

Huck nodded. “You know where we goin’?” the boy asked.

“Ain’t got no idee. But we’s on our way.”

* * *

—

**NIGHT CAME** and we set out. About an hour later a storm came up and started knocking us about like we were a toy in the water. Lightning flashed south of us, but it was clearly headed our way.

“Whatcha think?” I asked.

“Dunno.”

“Stay in the wata wif lightnin’ ain’t a good idee.”

“Look\!” he said. He pointed.

Ahead of us, grounded on a shoal, was a wrecked steamboat. It leaned at nearly forty-five degrees. Huck paddled us forward while I used my oar as a rudder and tried my best to turn us away.

“What are you doin’, Jim?”

“Ain’t no good idee to be goin’ in dere.”

“Sure it’s a good idea. Who knows what we might find? Might even be some treasure. Gold and silver and diamonds and like that. Maybe we’ll find us a lamp with a genie in it.”

“Kin you think of anythin’ that kin get a slave killed faster than havin’ him some gold? And the genie sho nuff won’t grant a slave no wish.”

“Maybe there’s food, cans of beans and like that. More bacon.”

He had a point, but still I shook my head.

“Well, I’m going aboard.”

I gave in and helped him paddle us near the wreck. Once close, we could see that the boat wasn’t quite fully lodged on the shoal, but tethered to a big tree. Huck tied us to some bushes down the bank.

I stopped at the back of the boat where the big paddle lay dead and motionless. A broken spoke pointed toward the sky and another toward the far bank. The name of the boat was written across its back.

“Wha dat says?” I asked.

*“Walter Scott,”* Huck said.

“Wonder who he be.”

“That be the name of the boat, Jim.”

“Oh.”

“You not coming aboard?” he asked.

“Ima stay right heah. I be keepin’ watch.”

“That’s a good idea,” Huck said. “Give a signal whistle if’n there’s danger or somebody’s comin’.”

I watched as Huck climbed up the slippery deck. I then ducked under the tilted hull to get out of the rain.

* * *

—

**BECAUSE OF THE WIND,** my cover was hardly cover at all. I was fairly soaked through. I tried to think but couldn’t. Then Huck came careening down the deck and slid off into the water. He was shaking.

“We have to get out of here,” he said. “We’ve got to get out of here. We gotta run, Jim.”

“What is it, Huck? What be da matter?” I asked as we made our way to where we’d tied our boat.

Before he could answer, we saw that our craft had come undone and had drifted far out into the river. “I reckon I did a poor job of tying,” the boy said. “We got to hide. We need to hide.”

“Why?”

“There was some robbers in that boat. They was splittin’ up their loot and then one of ’em said they was gonna have to kill another feller. I didn’t see him. I don’t know where that ’un is.”

“I done told you not to go in, din’t I.” I shook my head. “Well, cain’t change nuffin naw.”

We heard deep voices from the *Walter Scott*. I pulled Huck into the bushes. We watched as the men put their takings into a skiff. Then a big wave came and lifted the *Walter Scott* and dropped it with a thud. Lightning flashed and thunder shook us. The storm was on us.

The men went back into the riverboat. I knew we had to get out of there. Our boat was gone. When I looked at Huck I saw he had the same notion. We stayed hidden in the brush and worked our way close, then we dashed for the robbers’ skiff. I untied the rope and the current snatched us out into the river in mere seconds. Another big wave lifted and slammed the wreck again. The robbers came running out onto the deck. We couldn’t see them, but we heard them shouting and swearing. I took the oars and did little more than keep us from capsizing, which was enough work.

* * *

—

**THE SKY UNTWISTED** itself and the storm flashed north of us, the thunder just a rumble now. I managed the boat to the bank, not because day was breaking, but because I was exhausted. We pulled up into the trees and lay on our backs. We were plenty wet, but no rain fell.

Once it was light, we went through the robbers’ booty, as Huck called it. The boy was highly excited by the adventure of it all. I admired that, was envious of it, to tell the truth, to be able to feel that in a world without fear of being hanged to death, or worse.

It turned out that the robbers didn’t care much for eating, as there was no food in the cache. There was jewelry, clothing, cigars. And books. I had to hide my excitement about the discovery of books. As to the monetary value of books I had no knowledge, but their intellectual value was immediately evident.

Among them were copies of Voltaire’s *Treatise on Tolerance* and *All for the Best* and Rousseau’s *Discourse on Inequality*. These were books I had seen on Judge Thatcher’s shelves and was eager to read. There was also a Bible and a book about training horses. And one pamphlet. I held it and studied the worn cream-colored cover. *The Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Venture, a Native of Africa: But Resident Above Sixty Years in the United States of America.* The slim volume felt soft, as if handled by sweaty hands. The work purported to be “related by himself.” *Related*.

“Maybe we kin sell the jewels,” Huck said.

I nodded.

“Why you holdin’ them books?” Huck asked.

“Dey feels good,” I said.

“That’s funny. How kin a book feel good?” He grabbed the Rousseau and thumbed through it. “It ain’t even got pictures.”

“I likes the weight of ’em,” I said.

Huck stared at me for a long few seconds. “I guess I don’t understand niggers,” he said.

Somehow that word seemed strange coming out of Huck’s mouth. I think he heard it, too, because we shared an awkward silence.

“Mebe I learn m’self to read wif dese books,” I said.

“You could probably find somethin’ better to start with than these.” He noticed that I had pushed aside the Bible. “You don’t want this ’un? The Bible?”

I felt cornered. “No,” I said. “Kin I keep dese?”

“I sure as shootin’ don’t want ’em.”

I put them in the sack they’d come in.

“You is a mystery to me, Jim, a sho nuff mystery.”

“I reckon I is, Huck.”

“First you don’t wanna go to Illinois where you kin be free and then you start collectin’ books causin’ they make you feel good. I swear I don’t understand.”

<<<START>>>

I understand. I will now generate the text for Chapter 11 based on the provided outline and previous context, without including any additional content.

## Chapter 11: Wishes and Words

That night, as we sat by our small fire, Huck asked me, "Jim, you ever hear tell of a genie in a lamp?"

I shook my head. "What dat be?"

"Well, it's this magical creature that lives in a lamp, and if you rub the lamp, the genie comes out and grants you wishes. Anything you want."

I considered this for a moment. "How many wishes?"

"Usually three," Huck said, his eyes gleaming with excitement. "But sometimes it's just one big wish."

"And dis genie, he got to do whateber you say?"

Huck nodded vigorously. "That's right. He's bound to the lamp, so he has to do what the owner of the lamp says."

I frowned. "Sounds lak slavery to me."

Huck's excitement dimmed a bit. "I never thought of it like that. But I guess you're right. Still, wouldn't it be amazing to have wishes granted?"

"I s'pose," I said, not wanting to dampen his enthusiasm further. "What you wish for, Huck?"

The boy's face lit up again. "Oh, all sorts of things\! I'd wish for adventure, for sure. Maybe to be a pirate or an explorer. And I'd wish for you to be free, Jim. You and all the slaves."

His words touched me, but I couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness. "Dat be mighty kind of you, Huck. But freedom ain't jest 'bout wishin'. It be 'bout rights and such."

Huck looked thoughtful. "I reckon you're right, Jim. But if I had a genie, I'd make sure you got your rights, too."

I smiled at him, appreciating his heart even if he didn't fully understand. "You a good boy, Huck. But sometimes I think wishes can be dangerous things."

"How so?"

I sighed, feeling the weight of trying to explain complex ideas to a child. "Well, s'pose you wish for somethin' and it don't turn out like you 'spected? Like in dat story 'bout the monkey's paw?"

Huck's eyes widened. "What story?"

I realized my mistake too late. I had read that story in Judge Thatcher's library, but of course, I wasn't supposed to know how to read. "Oh, jest somethin' I heard 'bout once," I said quickly. "A man wishes for money and his son dies, and the money comes from the son's death benefit."

Huck shuddered. "That's awful, Jim. I'd never wish for nothing like that."

"Course not," I agreed. "But dat's the thing 'bout wishes. You never know how they gonna turn out."

We sat in silence for a while, the fire crackling between us. I could see Huck's eyes growing heavy.

"You should get some sleep, Huck," I said softly. "We got a long day ahead of us tomorrow."

He nodded, yawning. "You're right, Jim. G'night."

As Huck settled down on the wet carpet of leaves, I stayed awake, my mind churning. I thought about the books in my sack, the ones I'd taken from the robbers' loot. The urge to read them was almost overwhelming, but I knew I had to be careful. Reading was a dangerous thing for a slave – it could get me whipped or worse if I was caught.

But as I watched Huck's chest rise and fall in the steady rhythm of sleep, I realized something. Reading wasn't just dangerous because it was forbidden. It was dangerous because it was powerful. It opened up worlds, ideas, possibilities. It was a form of freedom that couldn't be chained or sold.

I glanced at my sack of books, then back at Huck. The boy was sound asleep now, his face peaceful in the dying firelight. Slowly, carefully, I reached for the sack and pulled out one of the novels. I couldn't read Voltaire or Rousseau tonight – their ideas were too complex, too demanding for my tired mind. But a novel... that could be an escape.

I opened the book, feeling the weight of it in my hands. The pages were slightly damp from our river journey, but the words were still clear. I began to read, my lips moving silently as I sounded out the words.

As the story unfolded, I felt myself being transported. I was no longer a runaway slave on a rickety raft in the middle of the Mississippi. I was in London, or Paris, or some other faraway place, living a life I could barely imagine. The characters' joys and sorrows became my own, their triumphs and failures echoing in my heart.

Every few minutes, I'd glance up to make sure Huck was still asleep. But as the night wore on, I found myself checking less and less frequently. I was too engrossed in the story, too caught up in this other world.

For those hours, as the moon crossed the sky and the fire burned down to embers, I was free. Not in the way Huck had wished for me to be free, not in the way that would let me walk down the street without fear. But free in my mind, free to explore and learn and grow.

As the first light of dawn began to creep over the horizon, I reluctantly closed the book. I tucked it back into the sack, making sure it was well hidden. Then I leaned back against a tree, my mind still full of the story I'd read.

I looked at Huck, still sleeping soundly, and felt a surge of affection for the boy. He wanted to free me with a wish, with the snap of a genie's fingers. He didn't understand that I was finding my own freedom, word by word, page by page.

As the river flowed endlessly past us, I closed my eyes, not to sleep, but to savor the feeling of the story still lingering in my mind. For a few precious hours, I had been somewhere else, someone else. And no matter what happened next, no one could take that away from me.## Chapter 11

## Chapter 12: Golightly

The morning sun had barely risen when we found our canoe and raft hung up in some brush downstream. It was a welcome sight after losing our original boat to the river's current. We decided to use our own craft to continue our journey, leaving behind the robbers' skiff.

As we drifted lazily down the Mississippi, Huck turned to me with a curious expression. "Jim," he said, "if you could choose any last name for yourself, what would it be?"

I hadn't given it much thought before. Slaves didn't have the luxury of last names, at least not ones that meant anything. "I don't rightly know, Huck," I said. "Never had no need for one."

Huck persisted, "But if you could pick one, any one at all, what would you choose?"

I pondered for a moment, letting the gentle lapping of the river against our raft fill the silence. Then it came to me, like a whisper on the breeze. "Golightly," I said. "Jim Golightly."

Huck's eyes lit up. "Golightly? That's a fine name, Jim. How'd you come up with that?"

"Well," I explained, "I figure a man should have a name that means somethin'. Golightly sounds like a man who don't carry no burdens, who can move through life easy-like. That's the kind of man I'd like to be."

Huck nodded, seeming to understand. "Jim Golightly," he repeated, testing the name on his tongue. "I like it."

We continued down the river, the day growing warmer as the sun climbed higher in the sky. The water was calm, and we let the current do most of the work, only steering occasionally to avoid obstacles.

As we rounded a bend, we heard the distant sound of a steamboat. Huck's eyes widened with excitement, but I felt a knot of fear in my stomach. We needed to get out of sight, and fast.

"Quick, Huck," I said, "we gotta hide."

But before we could do anything, the steamboat came into view, its massive paddle wheel churning the water into a froth. The wake it created tossed our little raft about like a toy, and in the chaos, I lost sight of Huck.

"Huck\!" I called out, panic rising in my chest. "Huck, where are you?"

The steamboat passed, but Huck was nowhere to be seen. I scanned the water frantically, my heart pounding. What if he had fallen in? What if he had drowned? The thought was almost too much to bear.

I paddled furiously, searching the river for any sign of the boy. Minutes felt like hours as I called his name over and over, my voice growing hoarse.

Finally, I spotted him clinging to a piece of driftwood not far from our raft. Relief washed over me as I pulled him aboard, checking him for injuries.

"I'm alright, Jim," Huck said, coughing up some water. "That was some excitement, wasn't it?"

I nodded, not trusting myself to speak just yet. As my heart rate returned to normal, I realized I needed to be more careful. If anyone had seen me searching so desperately for Huck, they might have gotten suspicious. So I decided to play it off as if nothing had happened.

"Well, Huck," I said, trying to sound casual, "that sho was a rough ride. I must've dozed off for a bit there."

Huck looked at me quizzically. "Dozed off? Jim, you were hollerin' my name something fierce."

I shook my head, feigning confusion. "I don't recall that. Must've been dreamin'."

A mischievous glint appeared in Huck's eye. "Oh, I see how it is," he said. "Well, let me tell you about this dream you had, Jim. You were carryin' on somethin' awful, cryin' out for me like I was your long-lost child."

I played along, pretending to be embarrassed. "Now, Huck, you know that ain't true."

"Oh, but it is\!" Huck insisted, warming to his tale. "You were weepin' and wailin', sayin' how you couldn't go on without me. It was quite touchin', really."

We both laughed then, the tension of the moment before dissipating like morning mist. But as our laughter faded, Huck's expression turned serious.

"Jim," he said, his voice low, "I've been thinkin'. Am I a bad person for helpin' you run away? I mean, I'm stealin' Miss Watson's property, ain't I?"

The question caught me off guard. I looked at Huck, seeing the genuine concern in his young face. How could I explain to him the complexities of morality in a world that saw me as less than human?

"Huck," I said carefully, "you ain't stealin' nothin'. A person can't be property, no matter what the law says. You're doin' what's right, even if it don't feel like it sometimes."

Huck nodded slowly, but I could see he was still troubled. "But how do I know what's right and what's wrong? The preacher says one thing, and Miss Watson says another, and Pap... well, Pap just says everything's wrong."

I sighed, looking out at the river flowing endlessly before us. "Huck, there's folks who think they know what's good and what's evil 'cause someone told 'em, or 'cause it's written down somewhere. But true goodness, it don't come from no book or no law. It comes from in here," I said, tapping my chest.

"You mean the heart?" Huck asked.

"The heart, the soul, whatever you want to call it," I said. "It's that part of you that knows right from wrong without having to be told. It's the part that made you want to help me, even though you been taught it's wrong."

Huck was quiet for a long time after that, mulling over my words. As the day wore on, we fell into a comfortable silence, listening to the river's song – the lapping of water against the raft, the occasional splash of a fish, the rustling of leaves on the shore.

As dusk began to fall, Huck spoke up again. "Jim," he said, "do you hear that?"

I listened carefully. "Hear what, Huck?"

"The Ohio," he said. "We must be gettin' close. They say you can hear it before you see it."

I shook my head. "That's just a story, Huck. We ain't nowhere near the Ohio yet."

"But when we do get there," Huck said, his voice full of hope, "that's where you'll be free, right? Once we cross into Illinois or Indiana?"

I nodded, feeling a mix of hope and apprehension. "That's the plan," I said. "But it ain't gonna be easy. Even in a free state, there's plenty of folks who'd turn in a runaway slave for the reward."

"I won't let that happen," Huck said fiercely. "I promise, Jim."

I smiled at his determination. "I know you won't, Huck. And I'm grateful for that. But there's more to it than just me bein' free. I got to find a way to buy freedom for my family too."

"Your family?" Huck asked, surprised. "You mean you're gonna go back for them?"

"Soon as I can," I said. "I can't be truly free knowin' they're still in chains. Someday, we'll all be together again, and we'll all be free."

As night fell fully, we steered our raft towards the shore to make camp. The stars came out, twinkling above us like a thousand distant lanterns. I looked at Huck, this boy who had become so much more than just my companion on this journey. He had become my friend, my confidant, and in many ways, my hope for a better future.

"Jim Golightly," Huck said softly, as if testing the name one more time. "I like the sound of that. It fits you."

I smiled in the darkness. "Maybe someday, Huck. Maybe someday."

As we drifted off to sleep, the river continued its eternal journey, carrying us ever closer to the promise of freedom. And for that moment, at least, the future seemed as bright and full of possibility as the stars above us.

## Chapter 13: Broken Apart

I woke with a start, the tarp over me rustling as I shifted. For a moment, I was disoriented, the gentle rocking of the raft beneath me at odds with the urgency I felt in my chest. Then I heard voices – Huck's familiar tones mixed with those of strangers – and I froze, hardly daring to breathe.

"Naw, sir," Huck was saying, his voice pitched higher than usual. "Ain't no runaway slaves here. Just me and my poor sick uncle."

"Your uncle, you say?" A gruff voice responded, skepticism clear in his tone. "What's wrong with him?"

"He's got the smallpox," Huck said quickly. "Real bad case. Doc says he ain't never seen nothin' like it."

I held my breath, willing the men to believe Huck's story. My heart was pounding so hard I was sure they must be able to hear it.

"Smallpox, you say?" The second man's voice was softer, but no less wary. "That's mighty dangerous, boy. You shouldn't be out here alone with him."

"Ain't got no choice," Huck replied, a quaver in his voice that I couldn't tell was real or feigned. "Ma and Pa are both dead, and there ain't nobody else to take care of him."

There was a long pause, and I could almost feel the men's eyes boring through the tarp, trying to see if Huck was telling the truth. I didn't dare move a muscle.

"Well," the gruff voice said at last, "I reckon we best be on our way then. Don't want to catch no smallpox ourselves."

"Wait," the softer voice interjected. "Boy, you take this. Get yourself and your uncle some food when you can."

"Gosh, mister, that's mighty kind of you," Huck said, and I could hear the genuine surprise in his voice. "Thank you kindly."

I heard the sound of footsteps retreating, then the splash of oars in water. Only when the sound had faded completely did I risk peeking out from under the tarp.

Huck was standing at the edge of the raft, a look of relief on his face that quickly turned to a grin when he saw me. "It's all clear, Jim," he said. "They're gone."

I sat up slowly, my heart still racing. "That was too close, Huck," I said, shaking my head. "We gotta get off this river soon as we can."

Huck nodded, then held out his hand. In it was a ten-dollar bill. "Can you believe it?" he said, wonder in his voice. "That man gave me ten whole dollars."

I couldn't help but smile at his excitement, even as worry gnawed at my gut. "That was quick thinkin', Huck," I said. "But we can't count on luck like that holdin' out. We need to find a way to get to shore and lay low for a spell."

Huck's face fell a bit, but he nodded. "You're right, Jim. I'll go check on the canoe, see if we can use it to get to shore quicker."

But when Huck went to where we'd tied the canoe, his face went pale. "Jim," he called, his voice tight with panic, "the canoe's gone."

My heart sank. Without the canoe, we were stuck on the raft, at the mercy of the river and anyone who might spot us. "We'll have to make do with what we got," I said, trying to sound more confident than I felt. "We'll find a quiet spot and pole our way to shore."

But the river seemed to have other plans. As the day wore on, we saw more traffic than we had in all our days on the water combined. Steamboats churned past, their wakes rocking our little raft dangerously. Ferries crisscrossed the river, forcing us to constantly adjust our course to avoid detection.

By nightfall, we were both exhausted and on edge. The darkness that had once been our ally now felt oppressive, hiding potential dangers. Every splash could be a pursuer, every distant light a searchboat looking for us.

"We should tie up for the night," I said, eyeing the shore warily. "Try to get some rest and figure out our next move in the morning."

Huck nodded, too tired to argue. We were just maneuvering towards a promising spot when we heard it – the low, rumbling horn of a steamboat, far too close for comfort.

"Jim\!" Huck cried out in warning, but it was too late. The wake hit us like a wall of water, lifting our raft and then dropping it with a sickening crack. I felt the logs beneath my feet start to give way, splitting apart under the force of the water.

"Hold on, Huck\!" I yelled, reaching for him even as I felt myself being thrown into the churning river. The cold water shocked me, stealing my breath. I flailed, desperate to keep my head above water, but the current was strong, pulling me under.

When I finally managed to surface, gasping for air, I couldn't see Huck anywhere. Panic gripped me as I spun in the water, searching desperately for any sign of him.

"Huck\!" I shouted, my voice barely audible over the rush of the river. "Huck, where are you?"

But there was no answer. The remnants of our raft were scattered around me, bobbing uselessly in the water. And Huck was gone.

I treaded water, my mind racing. Had he been pulled under? Had he managed to grab onto a piece of the raft? Or had the current already carried him far downstream?

As I floated there, alone in the vast darkness of the Mississippi, the full weight of our situation hit me. We were separated, our meager possessions lost, and I was a runaway slave alone on the river. The freedom I had been chasing suddenly felt further away than ever.

But I couldn't give up. Huck was out there somewhere, and I had to find him. With a deep breath, I started swimming, fighting against the current, searching for any sign of my young friend. The night was long, and the river was wide, but I was determined. I would find Huck, or I would die trying.

As I swam, the river seemed to whisper around me, its voice both comforting and mocking. It seemed to say, "Jim Golightly, you ain't free yet. The river ain't done with you, and your journey's far from over."

I gritted my teeth and pushed on, hoping against hope that somewhere in the darkness, Huck was doing the same. We had come too far to let the river win now. Somehow, some way, we would find each other again. We had to. Because in that moment, lost and alone on the mighty Mississippi, I realized that Huck wasn't just my ticket to freedom anymore. He was my friend, maybe the only true friend I'd ever had. And I wasn't about to let the river take that away from me.## Chapter 13

## Chapter 14: Shores of Freedom

The muddy bank of the Mississippi clung to me as I dragged myself out of the water, coughing and sputtering. My chest heaved as I gulped in air, the cool morning breeze sending a shiver through my soaked clothes. As my vision cleared, I realized I had no idea where I was or how far the river had carried me.

"You alright there, brother?"

The voice startled me, and I whipped around to see four black men standing a short distance away. They regarded me with a mixture of concern and wariness.

"I... I'm fine," I managed to say, still catching my breath. "Just took a longer swim than I intended."

The largest of the men, a muscular fellow with scars crisscrossing his arms, stepped forward. "You ain't from around here, are you?" he asked, his eyes narrowing slightly.

I hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. But something in their postures, the way they kept glancing over their shoulders, told me they might understand my situation.

"No," I admitted. "I'm... I'm running."

The tension in the group visibly eased at my words. The muscular man nodded. "Thought as much. Name's Josiah. This here's Old George, his boy Young George, and that's Pierre."

I introduced myself as Jim, still wary but relieved to find potential allies.

"Welcome to Illinois," Old George said, his voice gravelly with age. "Land of the free, they say."

Pierre, a lean man with suspicious eyes, snorted. "Free, my ass. Still gotta watch our backs every minute."

Josiah nodded grimly. "He ain't wrong. This my third time escaping. They catch you here, they just ship you right back down south."

The reality of my situation hit me anew. I had made it to a free state, but freedom was still far from assured. "How long you all been here?" I asked.

"'Bout a week," Young George answered. He was taller than his father, with clever hands that never seemed to stop moving. "Been trying to figure out our next move."

"You got any plans?" Josiah asked me.

I shook my head. "Lost my friend in the river. Was hoping to find him first."

"White boy?" Pierre asked sharply.

I nodded, and Pierre's face darkened. "Best forget about him. White folks ain't to be trusted, even the young ones."

"Pierre," Old George chided gently. "Not all white folks are the same."

"Enough are," Pierre muttered.

Josiah turned back to me. "You said you lost everything in the river. You need anything? Food? Clothes?"

I was about to decline when I remembered something. "Actually, there is one thing. You wouldn't happen to have a pencil, would you? And maybe some paper?"

The men exchanged surprised glances. "You can write?" Josiah asked, clearly impressed.

"And read," I admitted. "Taught myself in secret."

Josiah's eyes lit up. "I can read a little myself. Picked it up from my master's kids when they was learning. Never got the hang of writing though."

Pierre looked skeptical. "What you need to write for? Ain't safe to be leaving no trail."

"It ain't for leaving messages," I explained. "It's for... well, for thinking. Helps me sort things out in my head."

Young George nodded. "I get that. Sometimes I whittle when I'm trying to figure something out. Same idea, I reckon."

"I can probably find you a pencil," he continued. "Might take a day or two though. We try not to go into town too often, you know?"

I nodded, understanding their caution. "I appreciate it. And I understand if you can't. Just thought I'd ask."

Old George cleared his throat. "You planning on staying around here?"

I considered the question. "Figure I ought to lay low for a few days at least. Give anyone looking for me a chance to move on."

Josiah nodded approvingly. "Smart. There's some woods about a mile that way," he pointed. "Decent cover, and a stream for water. We've been camping there ourselves."

"Just watch out for dogs," Pierre warned. "They love using dogs to track us down."

The mention of dogs sent a chill down my spine. I'd heard stories of runaways torn apart by hunting hounds. "Any way to throw them off the scent?" I asked.

Old George spoke up. "Pepper works, if you can get it. Or you can try wading through water for a spell. Ain't foolproof, but it might buy you some time."

I nodded, grateful for the advice. "Thank you. All of you. I appreciate the help."

Josiah clapped me on the shoulder. "We gotta look out for each other. Ain't nobody else going to."

The men started to move off, conscious of the risk of being seen together for too long. As they left, Young George turned back. "I'll try to get you that pencil," he said. "Maybe even some paper if I can manage it."

I thanked him again, watching as the group disappeared into the trees. Left alone, I took stock of my situation. I was in Illinois, technically free, but still in constant danger. Huck was missing, possibly drowned in the river. And all my possessions, including my precious books, were lost.

But I was alive. And for the moment, that had to be enough.

I made my way towards the woods Josiah had pointed out, my mind churning with plans and worries. As I walked, I found myself wishing for my books, for the comfort and escape they provided. But perhaps, I thought, it was time to start writing my own story.

With that thought to sustain me, I pushed deeper into the Illinois wilderness, hoping that somewhere out there, Huck was doing the same.

Here is the text for Chapter 15 based on the provided outline:

## Chapter 15: The Weight of a Pencil

The days passed slowly in the Illinois woods. I foraged for berries and roots, caught fish with my hands when I could, and read. Reading in the open felt different than it had in the Judge's library or on the raft. More dangerous, somehow. More exposed. But I couldn't stop. The words were a lifeline, connecting me to a world beyond the trees and the constant fear of capture.

I thought about the books I'd read – the Bible with its promises and threats, Voltaire's biting wit questioning everything, Rousseau's ideas about natural man and society. They swirled in my head, a jumble of thoughts and questions I couldn't quite sort out. That's when I realized – I needed to write. To put the words down, to see them in front of me, to make sense of it all.

But I had no pencil, no paper. Just my thoughts and the endless green of the forest.

As dusk fell on the third day, I heard a rustle in the undergrowth. I tensed, ready to run, but then Young George's face appeared between the leaves.

"Got something for you," he said, grinning. He held out his hand, and in it was a pencil.

I took it reverently, feeling its weight in my palm. "How did you manage this?"

Young George's grin widened. "Turns out, even white folks don't always keep too close an eye on their pencils. Swiped it right off a store counter while the shopkeeper was fussing over some fancy lady's hat order."

We both laughed then, a quiet chuckle that felt dangerous and liberating all at once.

"Thank you," I said, once our laughter faded. "This means more than you know."

Young George nodded, his face turning serious. "You said writing helps you think. Well, if you're gonna tell your story, use these too." He tapped his ears. "Listen. Really listen. To the wind, to the animals, to the silence. That's where the real stories are."

With that cryptic advice, he melted back into the forest, leaving me alone with the pencil and my thoughts.

I turned the pencil over in my hands, marveling at its simple form and the worlds it could create. Young George was right – it was more than just a tool for writing. It was a key, unlocking doors in my mind I hadn't even known were there.

As night deepened, I lay back against a fallen log, the pencil clutched to my chest. I thought about Young George's words. Listen, he'd said. But to what? The forest was full of sounds – the rustle of leaves, the chirp of crickets, the occasional hoot of an owl. What stories could they tell me?

Then, cutting through the night, came a sound that made my blood run cold. Barking. The howl of hounds, distant but clear.

I pulled myself into a tighter ball atop the gnarled roots of a massive oak, straining my ears. The dogs were far off, but in which direction? Were they after me, or some other poor soul fleeing through the night?

A raccoon scurried up the trunk of my tree, pausing to look at me with gleaming eyes. We both listened to the dogs, two creatures uncertain which of us was the prey.

The howls grew louder, then fainter, then louder again. My heart raced. Should I run? But which way? The dogs seemed to be everywhere and nowhere at once.

So I stayed, frozen, clutching my precious pencil, listening to the night and wondering what story it was trying to tell me. Was this freedom? This constant fear, this uncertainty? Or was true freedom still somewhere ahead, waiting to be found?

As the dogs' voices faded into the distance, I loosened my grip on the pencil, feeling the indentations it had left in my palm. Tomorrow, I decided. Tomorrow I would write. I would tell my story, not just with my ears, but with this small stick of wood and graphite. And maybe, just maybe, in writing it down, I'd figure out where that story was supposed to go next.

For now, though, all I could do was listen to the night and hope that dawn would bring a quieter, safer day.## Chapter 15

----------------
## Chapter 16: The Sound of Freedom

I spent days in those Illinois woods, my mind churning with thoughts of the past and dreams of the future. I thought of Sadie and little Lizzie, wondering if they were safe, if they were looking up at the same stars I saw each night. I thought of Huck, hoping against hope that he had survived the river's fury. And I thought about freedom - what it meant, and whether I'd ever truly find it.

In quiet moments, I took out the pencil Young George had given me and practiced writing on scraps of bark. At first, my letters were clumsy, barely legible. But with each passing day, they grew clearer, more confident. I wrote my name over and over - Jim. Just Jim. No last name, no master's name attached. Just me.

Josiah, Old George, Pierre, and Young George visited when they could, always cautious, always looking over their shoulders. We'd talk in hushed voices about the challenges ahead, the risks we faced.

"You can't stay here forever, Jim," Josiah said one evening, his eyes scanning the darkening woods. "Sooner or later, someone's gonna stumble across you."

I nodded, knowing he was right. "I been thinking on that," I said. "Reckon I ought to keep moving north."

Old George raised an eyebrow. "North? That's a long way to go, son. Lot of danger between here and there."

"I know," I replied. "But I can't go back. And I can't stay here. I gotta find a life somewhere. Maybe... maybe even find a way to buy my family's freedom someday."

Pierre scoffed. "Buy their freedom? With what? You ain't got nothing but the clothes on your back."

"Not yet," I said, my hand unconsciously tightening around the pencil in my pocket. "But I will. Somehow."

Young George smiled, a glimmer of hope in his eyes. "If anyone can do it, Jim, it's you. You got that fire in you."

As they left that night, I made my decision. I would leave the next evening, under cover of darkness. I spent the day preparing, weaving a crude bag out of grass and reeds, filling it with the fish I'd caught and what berries I could find. As the sun set, I took one last look around the little clearing that had been my temporary refuge.

"Goodbye," I whispered to the trees, to the river in the distance, to the friends who had helped me. Then I turned north and began to walk.

The night was quiet, save for the occasional hoot of an owl or rustle of some small creature in the underbrush. I moved as silently as I could, every sense alert for danger. I had no real plan beyond "north," no destination in mind. Just the vague hope of finding somewhere I could be truly free.

I'd been walking for maybe an hour when I heard voices ahead. I froze, then carefully crept forward, staying low and hidden in the shadows. As I got closer, I could make out a group of people - slaves, from the look of them, with a couple of white overseers.

My heart nearly stopped when I recognized Young George among them. He was on his knees, his shirt torn from his back. One of the white men stood over him, a whip in his hand.

"Thought you could steal from us, boy?" the man snarled. "Thought we wouldn't notice a missing pencil?"

The whip cracked, and Young George's back arched in pain. He didn't cry out, but I could see the agony on his face.

Our eyes met for just a moment. In that instant, I saw everything - his pain, his fear, but also his determination. He gave me the tiniest of nods, his eyes flicking away, urging me to run.

I wanted to help him. Every fiber of my being screamed to rush out there, to stop the beating, to save my friend. But I knew I couldn't. If I revealed myself now, we'd both be lost.

So I did the only thing I could. I ran.

I ran like I'd never run before, my heart pounding, branches whipping at my face. I ran until my lungs burned and my legs felt like they might give out. And still I ran, the sound of that whip crack echoing in my ears, driving me forward into the unknown night.

As I ran, I made a silent promise - to Young George, to myself, to all those still trapped in bondage. I would find freedom. I would make something of myself. And someday, somehow, I would find a way to help others do the same.

The woods flew by in a blur, and with each step, I left behind the man I had been and moved towards the man I hoped to become. Jim. Just Jim. A free man, running towards a future he could barely imagine, but desperately hoped existed.

And as the night deepened around me, I realized that this - this terror, this hope, this desperate flight - this was the sound of freedom. Not a joyous song, not a triumphant cry, but the pounding of feet on forest floor, the ragged breath of a man running for his life and towards his future.

I ran on, into the night, into the unknown, towards whatever fate awaited me in the vast, perilous expanse of the north.

## Chapter 17: Reunited Amidst Chaos

The woods seemed to close in around me as I pushed on through the darkness. My legs ached from hours of running, and my breath came in ragged gasps. The sky was beginning to lighten in the east, and I knew I needed to find a hiding place soon. As I paused to catch my breath and get my bearings, I heard angry voices nearby.

"You can't do this, Sophia!" a man's voice shouted. "Think of your family!"

"My family?" a woman's voice replied, bitter and sharp. "My family is the reason we're in this mess!"

I crept closer, curiosity overriding caution. As I peered through the bushes, my heart nearly stopped. There, in the middle of a clearing, was Huck. He was alive!

Huck was standing between a young woman – Sophia, I presumed – and a group of men with guns. The tension in the air was thick enough to cut with a knife.

"Please," Huck was saying, "there's been enough killin' already. Just let her go."

One of the men raised his gun. "Stay out of this, boy. This ain't your fight."

Everything happened at once. Sophia turned and ran. The men shouted and raised their guns. And Huck, bless his quick-thinking soul, dropped to the ground and started crab-walking towards me as fast as he could.

Without thinking, I reached out and yanked Huck into the bushes just as the first shots rang out. We huddled there, hardly daring to breathe, as chaos erupted in the clearing.

The gunfire was deafening. Men shouted and cursed. I heard bodies falling, cries of pain cut short. And then, as suddenly as it had begun, it was over. The silence that followed was somehow even more terrible than the noise.

"Jim?" Huck whispered, his voice shaking. "Is that really you?"

"It's me, Huck," I said, relief washing over me. "I thought I'd lost you in the river."

"I thought I'd lost you too," he said. Then, seeming to remember where we were, he added, "We gotta get out of here. Those were the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons. They've been feuding for years, and it just got a whole lot worse."

We peered out from our hiding spot. The clearing was a scene of carnage. Bodies lay still on the blood-soaked grass. Off in the distance, I saw Sophia disappear into a stand of trees.

"Are they..." I couldn't finish the question.

Huck nodded grimly. "Dead. All of 'em, I reckon. We need to go, Jim. Now."

"But where?" I asked. "We don't have a boat, and they'll be searching the woods soon."

A ghost of a smile crossed Huck's face. "Actually, we do have a boat. Sort of. I found our old raft a few days back. It was pretty beat up, but I managed to fix it up some. It's hidden down by the river."

Hope surged through me. "Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!"

We moved as quietly as we could through the woods, always alert for any sign of pursuit. As we reached the river, I saw our battered but serviceable raft tucked away in some reeds.

"It ain't pretty," Huck said, "but it'll float."

"It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen," I replied, and I meant it.

We pushed the raft into the water and climbed aboard, using branches to pole ourselves out into the current. As the shore receded behind us, I felt a weight lift from my shoulders. We were together again, and we were free – for the moment, at least.

As we drifted downstream, Huck turned to me with a curious expression. "Jim," he said slowly, "when we first started talkin' back there... you didn't sound like yourself."

I felt a chill run down my spine. In the relief and excitement of our reunion, I had forgotten to maintain my usual manner of speaking.

"What you mean, Huck?" I said, carefully reverting to my usual patterns. "I's jest me, same as always."

Huck frowned. "I don't know. For a minute there, you sounded... different. More like... well, more like a white man, I guess."

I forced a laugh. "You must be hearin' things, Huck. All dat noise pro'ly addled yo' brain some."

He nodded, but I could see he wasn't entirely convinced. "I suppose you're right," he said. "It's been a crazy few days."

As Huck turned his attention to steering the raft, I let out a quiet sigh of relief. I would have to be more careful in the future. Huck was clever, and I couldn't risk him discovering the full extent of my education.

The river carried us onward, away from the tragedy we'd witnessed and towards an uncertain future. I looked at Huck, this boy who had become so dear to me, and silently vowed to protect him as best I could. Whatever challenges lay ahead, we would face them together.

As the sun rose fully, painting the river in shades of gold and pink, I allowed myself a moment of hope. We were alive, we were together, and we were free – for now. And sometimes, that has to be enough.## Chapter 17

Understood. I will now generate the text for Chapter 18 based on the provided outline and previous context.

## Chapter 18: Royalty on the River

The night was thick and heavy as we drifted down the Mississippi. Huck and I had been taking turns keeping watch, always alert for any sign of pursuit. We'd been lucky so far, but I knew our luck couldn't hold out forever.

"Jim," Huck said, breaking the silence, "you ever hear of anything like that feud between the Shepherdsons and Grangerfords?"

I shook my head. "Can't say I has, Huck. Seems like a powerful waste of life to me."

Huck nodded solemnly. "It was awful, Jim. All that killin' over... well, I don't even rightly know what it was over. Just seemed like they'd been fightin' so long, they'd forgotten why they started in the first place."

We lapsed back into silence, each lost in our own thoughts. As we rounded a bend in the river, Huck suddenly pointed to the shore. "Look there, Jim! Is that a canoe?"

I squinted into the darkness. Sure enough, tucked away on a sandy beach was a small canoe, partially hidden by overhanging branches.

"Reckon it is," I said. "What you thinkin', Huck?"

A mischievous grin spread across Huck's face. "I'm thinkin' we could use a little test run. You mind if I take it up that creek a ways? Won't be gone long, and you can check on our trotlines while I'm gone."

I hesitated, not liking the idea of separating, but I could see the excitement in Huck's eyes. "Alright," I said finally. "But be careful, and don't go too far."

As Huck paddled off in the canoe, I set about checking our trotlines. The work was monotonous, and my mind began to wander. Before I knew it, I had dozed off, slumping against the side of the raft.

In my dream, I found myself in a grand library, surrounded by towering shelves of books. Sitting across from me was a man I recognized from the portrait in Judge Thatcher's study – John Locke.

"Tell me, Jim," Locke said, his eyes twinkling with curiosity, "what do you make of the hypocrisy of those who preach freedom while denying it to others?"

I considered the question carefully. "It seems to me, Mr. Locke, that such hypocrisy stems from a failure to recognize the humanity in all people. They speak of natural rights, but then arbitrarily decide who is worthy of those rights."

Locke nodded approvingly. "And what of morality? Is it absolute, or does it change based on circumstance?"

Before I could answer, I was jolted awake by the sound of Huck's voice and the splash of oars. "Jim! Jim, wake up! We gotta go!"

I blinked, disoriented, to see Huck paddling furiously towards the raft. Behind him, in the canoe, were two white men – one young and short, the other old and tall. And in the distance, I could hear the baying of dogs.

Without a word, I sprang into action, helping Huck secure the canoe to our raft. We pushed off into the current, our hearts pounding as we listened to the dogs growing fainter in the distance.

Once we were safely away, Huck turned to the two men. "You fellas want to tell us what that was all about?"

The younger man, who was short and fat, puffed out his chest. "Well, sir, you are in the presence of royalty. I am the Duke of Bridgewater, unjustly deprived of my titles and lands."

The older man, tall and gaunt, let out a snort. "Duke? Hah! Boy, you are addressing the Dauphin himself – the rightful King of France!"

Huck and I exchanged a glance. It was clear these men were nothing but low-down frauds, but something in their desperate eyes made me hold my tongue.

"Well," Huck said slowly, "we're mighty honored to have such distinguished company. Ain't we, Jim?"

I nodded, playing along. "Oh, yes suh. It's a powerful honor, suh."

The "Duke" and the "King" seemed to relax a bit, apparently satisfied that we had bought their ridiculous stories.

As we continued down the river, I couldn't shake the feeling that our journey had just become a whole lot more complicated. These men were clearly dangerous – not just to us, but to anyone unlucky enough to cross their path.

Huck caught my eye and gave me a small nod. I knew we were thinking the same thing – we'd have to be careful, very careful, around these self-proclaimed royals. But for now, all we could do was go along with their charade and hope for the best.

The Mississippi flowed on, dark and mysterious, carrying us towards an uncertain future. As I settled in for a long night of watchfulness, I couldn't help but think of my interrupted dream. What would John Locke make of this situation, I wondered? And more importantly, how were Huck and I going to navigate these treacherous waters – both literal and figurative – that lay ahead?

With a sigh, I turned my attention back to the river, keeping a wary eye on our new companions. Whatever came next, I knew one thing for certain – our journey had just taken a turn into even more dangerous territory.## Chapter 18

## Chapter 19: Royalty and Ruses

The morning sun had barely risen when the Duke and the King began their interrogation. They sat at one end of the raft, eyeing Huck and me with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.

"So, boy," the King drawled, his gaze fixed on Huck, "what's your story? And what's a young white lad like yourself doing traveling with a nigger?"

I tensed at the slur, but Huck didn't miss a beat. "Well, sir," he said, his voice steady, "Jim here ain't no runaway, if that's what you're thinkin'. He belongs to my uncle down in New Orleans."

The Duke raised an eyebrow. "And why, pray tell, are you headed south? Most folks trying to get away tend to go north."

Huck's face clouded with what looked like genuine sorrow. "It's a sad tale, Your Grace. You see, my family was on a riverboat headed to visit my uncle when there was a terrible accident. The boiler exploded, and... well, I'm the only one who made it out alive."

I marveled at Huck's ability to spin such a convincing lie on the spot. The boy had a gift, that was certain.

"Jim here," Huck continued, gesturing towards me, "he was already down in New Orleans with my uncle. When news of the accident reached them, my uncle sent Jim to find me and bring me home safely."

The King's eyes narrowed. "That's quite a story, boy. But why would your uncle send a slave on such an important mission?"

"Jim ain't just any slave, sir," Huck replied. "He practically raised me. My uncle trusts him more than most white folks."

I kept my face carefully neutral, though inside I was both impressed by Huck's quick thinking and touched by the sentiment behind his words.

The Duke and the King exchanged a look, then seemed to relax a bit. "Well," the Duke said, "that's a right tragic tale. You have our deepest sympathies, young sir."

"Indeed," the King added, though his eyes still held a calculating gleam. "Perhaps we could rest on shore for a spell? There's a storm brewing, and I'd rather not be caught on this flimsy raft when it hits."

We guided the raft to a secluded spot on the riverbank and waited out the storm. The Duke and the King huddled under a makeshift shelter, while Huck and I tended to the raft to make sure it didn't drift away.

"You think they believed us?" I whispered to Huck when we were out of earshot.

Huck shrugged. "Don't matter if they did or not. We just gotta keep our eyes open and be ready for whatever they might try."

As the storm passed and we set off again, I couldn't help but notice how the Duke and the King had taken up most of the space on the raft, leaving Huck and me cramped and uncomfortable. They complained constantly about the lack of proper food and accommodations, as if they truly were royalty forced to slum it with commoners.

"I say," the Duke announced on the third day, "we ought to go into the next town we come across. Put on a show, perhaps. Make some money."

Huck frowned. "I don't know if that's such a good idea. What about Jim? It ain't safe for him to be seen in town."

The King waved a dismissive hand. "Oh, that's easily solved. I'll claim ownership of him. No one will question it."

I felt a chill run down my spine at his words. Huck's face hardened. "Now, hold on just a minute," he said, his voice low and dangerous. "Jim belongs to my uncle, like I told you. I can't let you go claiming him as yours."

"But think of the opportunities, my boy!" the King exclaimed. "With a strong slave like Jim, we could make a fortune!"

I saw the anger flash in Huck's eyes, and for a moment, I feared he might lash out at the King. But he took a deep breath and spoke calmly. "I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but I can't allow that. Jim is under my protection, and I gave my word to my uncle that I'd bring him back safe."

The tension on the raft was palpable. The Duke and the King exchanged another of their meaningful looks, and I knew we were in for trouble. These men weren't used to being denied, and I doubted they'd take kindly to a young boy standing in the way of their schemes.

As night fell and we tied up the raft, I couldn't shake the feeling that things were about to take a turn for the worse. Huck and I would have to be more vigilant than ever if we wanted to make it through this journey in one piece.

I looked at Huck, his young face set in determination, and felt a surge of gratitude. Whatever came next, I knew I could count on him. We'd face it together, just as we had everything else on this long and perilous journey.

The river flowed on, dark and mysterious, carrying us towards an uncertain future. But as I settled in for another night of watchfulness, I found comfort in the knowledge that, come what may, Huck and I would find a way through. We had to. The alternative was simply unthinkable.

## Chapter 20: The Revival Ruse

The Duke and the King woke us before dawn, their faces set with determination. "Up and at 'em, boys," the King barked. "We've got business to attend to in town."

I exchanged a worried glance with Huck. We'd hoped to avoid going into any towns, knowing the dangers it posed for me. But it was clear the Duke and the King weren't giving us a choice.

"Now, Jim," the Duke said, his voice syrupy sweet, "you just keep your head down and let us do the talking. No one's going to question you as long as you're with us."

We secured the raft in a hidden cove and made our way into town. The streets were eerily quiet, with only a few early risers about their business. As we passed a general store, a man stepped out, eyeing us suspiciously.

"You folks new in town?" he asked, his gaze lingering on me.

The King stepped forward, all charm and bluster. "Indeed we are, good sir. Might you direct us to where we might find some refreshment?"

The man jerked his thumb down the road. "Most everybody's at the revival meeting in Deacon Turner's field. Been going on for three days now."

The Duke's eyes lit up at this news. "A revival, you say? Well, isn't that fortunate. We were just on our way to spread the good word ourselves."

The man muttered something under his breath and hurried away, leaving us standing in the street.

"A revival," the King mused, stroking his scraggly beard. "Now that's an opportunity if I ever saw one."

We followed the sound of singing until we came upon a large clearing. Hundreds of people were gathered, swaying and clapping as a large, heavy-set white man led them in a rousing hymn.

The Duke turned to us, his eyes gleaming. "Now, you boys just sit tight and watch how it's done. We're about to bring these good people a show they'll never forget."

Before we could protest, the Duke strode forward, pushing his way through the crowd until he reached the front. As the hymn ended, he raised his hands dramatically.

"Brothers and sisters!" he cried, his voice ringing out across the field. "I come before you today as a humble sinner, seeking redemption!"

The crowd fell silent, all eyes fixed on the Duke.

"For years, I lived a life of sin and depravity," he continued, his voice quavering with fake emotion. "I was a pirate, sailing the seven seas, pillaging and plundering. But then, praise be, I saw the light!"

A murmur ran through the crowd. The preacher, momentarily taken aback, stepped forward. "And what, sir, brought about this miraculous change?"

The Duke clasped his hands together, looking skyward. "It was a vision, reverend. A vision of our Lord Jesus Christ himself, standing on the water, calling me to repentance!"

This declaration was met with a chorus of "Amens" and "Hallelujahs" from the crowd. The King, seeing his opportunity, pushed forward to join the Duke.

"And I, too, have a tale of redemption to share," he announced. "For I was once a great actor, spreading moral corruption through the theaters of Europe. But now, I use my talents only to glorify the Lord!"

With that, the King launched into what I assumed was meant to be a Shakespearean monologue, though it sounded more like gibberish to my ears. The crowd watched in bewildered silence.

"To be, or not to be, that is the bare bodkin," the King declaimed, waving his arms wildly. "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing, end them?"

The Duke, seeing the confusion on people's faces, quickly stepped in. "My friends, what you have just witnessed is a sacred performance, passed down through the ages. Now, who among you feels moved to support our holy mission?"

To my amazement, people began digging into their pockets, pressing coins and bills into the Duke and King's hands. Huck and I watched in disbelief as the pile of money grew.

But then, the King made a fatal mistake. Caught up in his performance, he cried out, "And let us not forget the words of that great Jewish prophet, Shylock: 'If you prick us, do we not bleed?'"

A hush fell over the crowd. The preacher's eyes narrowed. "Shylock?" he said slowly. "I don't recall any Jewish prophets in the Bible."

The Duke tried to salvage the situation. "Ah, but you see, reverend, that's because Shylock's writings were lost to time. Only recently rediscovered in the Holy Land!"

But the damage was done. The crowd began to murmur, suspicion replacing their earlier fervor.

"Now wait just a minute," a broad-shouldered man near the front called out. "I think these fellas are trying to pull the wool over our eyes!"

The King puffed out his chest. "Sir, I assure you, we are men of God!"

"Men of God, my foot!" the man retorted. "You're nothing but a couple of low-down, dirty swindlers! I want my money back!"

This cry was taken up by others in the crowd. "Yeah, give us back our money!" "Liars!" "Charlatans!"

The Duke and King looked around frantically, realizing their scheme had backfired spectacularly. 

"Now, now, good people," the Duke tried, but his words were drowned out by the growing roar of the crowd.

"Hang 'em!" someone shouted. "String 'em up!"

As the mob surged forward, I grabbed Huck's arm. "We gotta get out of here," I hissed.

Huck nodded, his face pale. "But what about them?" he asked, gesturing towards the Duke and King, who were now backing away from the angry crowd.

I hesitated for a moment. Part of me wanted to leave those two con men to face the consequences of their actions. But I knew we couldn't abandon them, no matter how much trouble they'd caused us.

"We'll have to find a way to help them," I said grimly. "But first, we need to make sure we don't end up swinging from a tree ourselves."

As we edged our way towards the outskirts of the crowd, I could hear the preacher's booming voice trying to restore order. But the mob's fury had been unleashed, and I feared what would happen next.

The Duke and King had played their last hand, and now we were all in danger. Whatever happened next, I knew one thing for certain – our journey had just become infinitely more perilous.
