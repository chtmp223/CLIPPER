The narrative is set in the late 19th century, primarily within the dense and mysterious forests of Guayana, Venezuela. The story follows the journey of a young Venezuelan man, who, after becoming embroiled in a political conspiracy and fleeing to the wilderness, finds himself immersed in a world of indigenous tribes, unexplored territories, and a profound connection with nature.

Upon escaping political persecution, the protagonist decides to explore the largely uncharted territories south of the Orinoco River, driven by a deep fascination with the indigenous peoples and the natural world. His journey leads him to the Maquiritari tribe in the Queneveta mountains, where he begins to recover from a debilitating fever. However, his restless spirit soon compels him to continue his exploration, eventually leading him to the Parahuari mountains, where he hopes to discover the fabled gold rumored to exist there.

In Parahuari, the protagonist encounters Runi, the chief of a small indigenous community, and his family, including the mysterious and ethereal Rima. Rima is unlike anyone the protagonist has ever met, with her unique beauty, mysterious language, and deep connection to the forest. She is a being of the wild, seemingly at one with the natural world, and possesses the ability to communicate with animals and nature in a way that fascinates and bewilders the protagonist.

The protagonist becomes enthralled by Rima and her enigmatic presence, leading him to spend more time in the forest, attempting to understand her and the secrets she holds. Rima, in turn, is both curious and wary of the protagonist, leading to a series of encounters that deepen their connection. The protagonist learns that Rima is searching for her lost people, whom she believes are the only ones who can understand her fully.

As the protagonist delves deeper into the mysteries of the forest and Rima's past, he learns that she is the last of her kind, a unique race with a profound bond to the natural world. Her mother had fled from a distant place called Riolama, where their people were believed to have been wiped out by hostile tribes. This revelation sets the protagonist on a journey with Rima and her grandfather, Nuflo, to Riolama, in hopes of discovering more about her origins and potentially finding her lost kin.

The journey is fraught with danger, as they traverse treacherous landscapes and encounter hostile tribes. Along the way, the protagonist's bond with Rima deepens, transcending language and cultural barriers. However, upon reaching Riolama, they find no trace of Rima's people, confirming the tragic fate of her race.

The narrative explores themes of isolation, the clash between civilization and the natural world, and the profound connections that can transcend cultural and linguistic barriers. It delves into the protagonist's internal struggle as he grapples with his past actions and seeks redemption through his connection with Rima and the natural world she embodies.

In the end, the protagonist's journey is as much about self-discovery and redemption as it is about uncovering the mysteries of Rima and her lost people. The story concludes with the protagonist reflecting on his experiences and the indelible impact Rima and the forest have had on his life, leaving him forever changed by the beauty and mystery of the world he has come to love.
