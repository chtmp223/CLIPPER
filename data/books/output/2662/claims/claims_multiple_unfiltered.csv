2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the claim inaccurately states that Reuben and William Dewy are active members of the choir. The chapter outline does not support this assertion, as it only confirms Dick's involvement.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation but rather a factual inaccuracy based on the provided information.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it misrepresents the roles of Reuben and William Dewy.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The phasing out of traditional string instruments is linked to both the vicar's preference for organ music and the disruption caused by the school-girls' participation, which signifies a shift in musical practices.
