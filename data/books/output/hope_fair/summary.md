The Bobbsey twins—Bert, Nan, Flossie, and Freddie—are excited about their upcoming Sunday school picnic. The outing promises fun and adventure, and the children, along with their friends, eagerly anticipate the day. The twins' parents, Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey, are also involved, ensuring everything is set for a delightful time.

As the picnic day unfolds, the children enjoy various activities, including swings, games, and a boat ride on a small lake. Bert, the older brother, is busy making a wooden boat for Freddie, while Nan takes on a motherly role, looking after Flossie and Freddie. The twins' excitement is palpable, especially as they await the arrival of the trucks that will take them to the picnic grounds.

Trouble arises when the truck carrying the children crosses a bridge that suddenly begins to break. The bridge sags under the weight, causing a tense moment, but the driver manages to keep the situation under control, and everyone disembarks safely. The incident, however, is a reminder of the unpredictable nature of such outings.

At the picnic grounds, the children are thrilled with the various activities available. Bert and his friends engage in a baseball game, while Flossie and Freddie explore the area, finding nests and gathering eggs. Meanwhile, Nan, ever the responsible one, keeps a watchful eye on her younger siblings.

The day takes a more adventurous turn when the children encounter a traveling merry-go-round, run by a gruff man named Mr. Blipper and a ragged boy called Bob Guess. The merry-go-round's organ music captivates the children, and Mr. Bobbsey pays for a short performance to entertain them. Bob Guess, an orphan working for Mr. Blipper, strikes a chord with the Bobbsey twins, especially when he shares how he was taken from an orphanage and given a life on the road with the merry-go-round.

As the day winds down, Mr. Bobbsey discovers his coat, containing important papers and money, is missing. An old, ragged coat is left in its place, leading to suspicions about its disappearance. The lap robe from their auto is also gone, adding to the mystery.

Back home, the family discusses the day's events, and Mr. Bobbsey contemplates the idea of visiting the Bolton County Fair, where Mr. Blipper's merry-go-round is headed. The children are excited about the prospect, especially with the promise of rides and new adventures.

The next day, while preparing for the trip to Meadow Brook Farm, where they plan to stay before visiting the fair, they encounter Bob Guess again. The boy has run away from Mr. Blipper, unable to endure the harsh treatment any longer. The Bobbseys, sympathetic to Bob's plight, offer him food and temporary shelter.

However, Mr. Blipper tracks Bob down, demanding his return. Despite Mr. Bobbsey's concerns about Bob's well-being, the legal papers Mr. Blipper presents force Bob to return with him. The Bobbseys promise to keep an eye on Bob at the fair, ensuring he is treated well.

The journey to Meadow Brook Farm continues, with the children excited about the upcoming fair. They enjoy the farm's simple pleasures, like swinging under the apple tree and playing by the brook. As they settle into farm life, the anticipation of the fair grows, promising more adventures and perhaps a resolution to the mystery of the missing coat and lap robe.

Throughout the narrative, the Bobbsey twins demonstrate their resilience and adventurous spirit, navigating the ups and downs of their experiences with curiosity and courage. Their interactions with characters like Bob Guess highlight themes of empathy and justice, as the family seeks to do right by the boy caught in an unfortunate situation. As the story unfolds, the twins' adventures at the fair are set to bring new challenges and joys.
