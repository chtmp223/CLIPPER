- Relationship: Connection between the strange voice, the cry, and Défago's claim",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. The strange voice calling ""Dé-fa-go!"": This part is grounded in event 2 of Chapter 4, where a powerful voice calls out to Défago, causing him to flee into the forest.
   b. The distant cry mentioning ""fiery height"" and ""burning feet of fire"": This part is grounded in event 4 of Chapter 7, where a distant cry mentions these phrases.
   c. Défago's claim of having seen the Wendigo: This part is grounded in event 5 of Chapter 8, where Défago claims to have seen the Wendigo.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The strange voice and the distant cry are both associated with Défago's experiences and his claim of encountering the Wendigo. The voice calling ""Dé-fa-go!"" is a precursor to his terror and subsequent disappearance, while the cry mentioning ""fiery height"" and ""burning feet of fire"" aligns with the transformation and terror associated with the Wendigo, as described in the summary and chapter outlines.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly supported by the events in the chapter outlines and the summary, which connect these occurrences to the Wendigo legend.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as both the voice and the cry are linked to the supernatural elements surrounding Défago's encounter with the Wendigo.

   b. ""are connected to Dr. Cathcart's claim of having seen the Wendigo"": This part is not directly grounded in the chapter outline or summary. Dr. Cathcart does not claim to have seen the Wendigo; rather, he discusses the legend of the Wendigo in Chapter 7.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid. The claim suggests a direct connection between the strange voice and cry and Dr. Cathcart's claim, but Dr. Cathcart does not claim to have seen the Wendigo. Instead, he discusses the legend, which is a separate context.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation, as it assumes a connection not explicitly stated in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as there is no indication that Dr. Cathcart claims to have seen the Wendigo.

- Relationship: Contrast in track visibility",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of each atomic part:
   a. ""Simpson initially observes alarming changes in the tracks he follows, including appallingly altered human footprints and animal tracks with a reddish tinge"": This part is grounded in event 1 of Chapter 5, where Simpson notices changes in the tracks.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The claim describes a sequence of events where Simpson observes changes in the tracks, and later, Dr. Cathcart and Hank are unable to find traces due to fresh snow. This sequence is coherent and follows a logical progression from observation to the inability to find traces.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation or assumption; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
