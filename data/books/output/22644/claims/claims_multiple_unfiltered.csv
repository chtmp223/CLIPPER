- Relationship: Cause and effect, plot development",Unique,Valid claim,INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. The $500 reward offered for catching the robbers: This part is grounded in event 5 of Chapter 15, where Glen overhears the discussion about the reward.
   b. Resulted in the successful capture of all five gang members by the sheriff's party: This part is grounded in Chapter 17, where the sheriff's party captures the gang members.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid. While the reward is mentioned, there is no direct causal link established in the chapter outline or summary that the reward directly led to the capture of the gang members. The capture is described as a result of Glen and Chick-chick's discovery and subsequent actions, not the reward.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation, as the claim implies causation that is not explicitly stated in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not contradict any information in the summary or outline, but it is not supported by the provided details.

Since the relationship between the atomic parts is not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline and is a subjective interpretation, the claim is INVALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. The $5000 reward offered for catching the robbers: The chapter outline mentions a $500 reward in Chapter 15, event 5, not $5000. This part is not grounded in the chapter outline.
   b. Glen overheard about the reward: This part is grounded in Chapter 15, event 5, where Glen overhears a conversation about the reward.
   c. Resulted in the successful capture of three out of five gang members by the sheriff's party: The chapter outline in Chapter 17, events 3-5, describes the capture of the gang members, but it does not specify that the reward directly resulted in their capture. The capture is attributed to Glen and Chick-chick's discovery and reporting to the sheriff.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the claim incorrectly states the reward amount and implies a direct causation between the reward and the capture, which is not supported by the chapter outline.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation, as the chapter outline does not explicitly link the reward to the capture of the gang members.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the reward amount is incorrect, and the capture is due to Glen and Chick-chick's actions rather than the reward.
