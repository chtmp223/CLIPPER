Tom Swift, a well-known young inventor, is eager for new adventures after a period of inactivity. He has been working on a new electric rifle, which he demonstrates to his friend, Ned Newton. The rifle is capable of firing wireless charges of electricity instead of bullets, and it can also shoot luminous charges that illuminate targets at night. This invention excites Tom, who dreams of using it on a big game hunt in Africa.

Tom's father, Mr. Swift, encourages him to pursue this adventure, and Tom begins preparing for a trip to Africa, where he plans to hunt elephants. He intends to take along a new airship, the Black Hawk, which is a combination of a biplane and a dirigible balloon, capable of both aerial and ground navigation. The airship is designed for quick ascents and descents, which is crucial for navigating the African jungle.

Tom's preparations include assembling a team for the expedition. His friend, Ned Newton, and the eccentric Mr. Damon, who is known for his habit of blessing everything, agree to join him. They also meet Mr. Durban, an experienced elephant hunter, who is enthusiastic about Tom's electric rifle and the prospect of using an airship for hunting. Together, they plan to travel to the African coast, where they will reassemble the Black Hawk and journey into the interior.

As they prepare for the expedition, news arrives that Andy Foger, a rival of Tom's, has gone missing in Africa after a failed aviation stunt. This adds an element of intrigue to their journey, as they might encounter Andy during their travels.

Onboard the steamer Soudalar, heading to Africa, Tom and his friends meet Mr. Floyd Anderson, a man they had previously rescued from Earthquake Island. Mr. Anderson reveals that he is on a mission to rescue two missionaries, Mr. and Mrs. Illingway, who have been captured by a fierce tribe known as the red pygmies. These pygmies are small, covered in reddish hair, and are known for their ferocity. Tom and his friends agree to assist Mr. Anderson in the rescue mission, adding a humanitarian purpose to their expedition.

During the voyage, the Soudalar encounters a whale, which, after a fierce battle with a killer fish, mistakenly attacks the ship. The whale rams the vessel, causing panic among the passengers. Tom quickly retrieves his electric rifle and, with precise aim, uses it to kill the whale, preventing further damage to the ship.

Upon arriving in Africa, the group plans to reassemble the Black Hawk and set off into the jungle. Their dual mission is to hunt elephants for ivory and to rescue the captured missionaries from the red pygmies. Tom's innovative spirit and adventurous nature, combined with his powerful inventions, set the stage for an exciting journey into the heart of Africa, where danger and discovery await.
