   b. ""Nan's father fails to recognize her and asks who she is"": This part contradicts event 6 of Chapter 21, where Nan's father recognizes Aunt Isabel and addresses her as ""Bell"" with great emotion.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid because the claim states that Nan's father fails to recognize Aunt Isabel, which directly contradicts the chapter outline where he recognizes her.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is a factual error based on the provided outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it contradicts the events described.

Since the second atomic part contradicts the chapter outline, the claim is INVALID."
