Jac Kennon, a recent graduate in veterinary medicine, arrives on the planet Kardon, where he is offered an unusually high-paying job with Outworld Enterprises Incorporated. The planet is home to the Lani, a humanoid species with a striking resemblance to humans but distinguished by their tails. The Lani are treated as livestock and are integral to the economic operations of the company. Kennon is hired to manage the health of the Lani, but he quickly becomes embroiled in the ethical and moral implications of their treatment.

Upon arrival, Kennon meets Alexander X. M. Alexander, the entrepreneur who runs Outworld Enterprises. Alexander is a shrewd businessman who controls the company with an iron grip, despite opposition from his family, who also have stakes in the business. The family dynamics are complex, with members like Douglas, Alexander's cousin, causing disruptions and others like Eloise, Alexander's sister, exhibiting predatory behavior.

Kennon is introduced to the Lani and is initially shocked by their human-like appearance and the conditions in which they live. He learns that the Lani are bred and trained for various tasks, including labor and export. The island of Flora, where the Lani reside, is a self-sufficient agricultural hub, and the Lani are crucial to its operations.

As Kennon settles into his role, he discovers an outbreak of liver flukes among the Lani, a problem that had been overlooked by his predecessor, Dr. Williamson, due to his failing health. The fluke infestation poses a significant threat to the Lani population, and Kennon is tasked with eradicating it. He approaches the problem methodically, understanding that it requires breaking the parasite's life cycle, a task complicated by the Lani's unique biology and the island's isolated ecosystem.

Throughout his work, Kennon grapples with the ethical implications of the Lani's status. Officially declared non-human by a Brotherhood court, the Lani are treated as animals, yet their intelligence and human-like characteristics challenge this classification. Kennon's interactions with Copper, a Lani who becomes his secretary, further complicate his feelings. Copper is intelligent, perceptive, and challenges Kennon's preconceptions about the Lani.

Kennon's investigation into the Lani's origins reveals that they might be the descendants of human missionaries who landed on Kardon millennia ago. This revelation has the potential to redefine the Lani's status, but it also puts Kennon at odds with Alexander and the company's interests. The situation is further complicated by the presence of Alexander's family, who have their own agendas and could disrupt Kennon's efforts.

Kennon's journey is one of moral and ethical discovery as he navigates the complexities of his role, the Lani's treatment, and the potential implications of their true origins. His struggle is not only with the biological challenges posed by the fluke infestation but also with the broader question of what it means to be human and the responsibilities that come with that understanding. As he works to solve the immediate health crisis, Kennon must also consider the long-term implications of his discoveries for the Lani and for the human society that has subjugated them.
