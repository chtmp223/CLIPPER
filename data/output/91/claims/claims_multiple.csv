   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation, but it is based on incorrect information regarding the desert's identity.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline due to the incorrect identification of the desert.

Since the claim contains incorrect information about the desert's identity, it is not consistent with the chapter outline, making the claim INVALID."

    a. ""After finding themselves over the Atlantic Ocean"": This part is grounded in event 6 of Chapter 3, where the group finds themselves over the Atlantic Ocean.
    b. ""the group spots land they believe to be England"": This part is grounded in event 4 of Chapter 5, where the group spots land and believes it to be England.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The sequence of events follows a logical progression: the group is over the Atlantic Ocean, spots land they believe to be England, and upon landing, they find themselves in a desert.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it aligns with the adventurous and unpredictable nature of their journey.
