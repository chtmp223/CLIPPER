   a. ""Kazan's protective instinct towards humans is demonstrated when he stops attacking upon discovering a girl and baby on a sledge"": This part is grounded in event 6 of Chapter 5, where Kazan reaches the sledge, discovers a girl and a baby, and stops his attack.
   b. ""later allows Pierre to bring him to camp despite being injured"": This part is grounded in event 2 of Chapter 6, where Kazan, injured from fighting the wolves, is found by Pierre and brought back to the camp.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is meaningful and objectively valid. Both parts of the claim illustrate instances where Kazan's behavior reflects a protective or non-aggressive stance towards humans, aligning with the theme of his internal conflict between the wild and human companionship.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly supported by the events in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it highlights Kazan's dual nature and his interactions with humans, which is a central theme in the narrative.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""Kazan's aggressive instinct towards humans is demonstrated when he continues attacking upon discovering a girl and baby on a sledge"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. In Chapter 5, Kazan stops his attack upon discovering the girl and baby on the sledge, which contradicts the claim that he continues attacking.
    b. ""Later refuses to let Pierre bring him to camp despite being injured"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. In Chapter 6, Kazan is found by Pierre and brought back to the camp despite initial hostility, but there is no mention of Kazan refusing to let Pierre bring him to camp.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the first part of the claim is contradicted by the chapter outline, and the second part is not supported by the outline.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the events described in the claim do not align with the provided information.

- Relationship: Joan's consistent care for Kazan",Unique,Valid claim,INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Joan consistently cares for Kazan"": This part is partially grounded in the chapter outline. Joan calls Kazan from her cabin in Chapter 8, event 2, and tends to his wounds in Chapter 9, event 5. However, the term ""consistently"" implies a regular or ongoing action, which is not explicitly supported by the outline. The outline only provides two instances of care, which may not be sufficient to establish consistency.
   b. ""calling him from her cabin"": This part is grounded in Chapter 8, event 2.
   c. ""tending to his wounds when he is injured"": This part is grounded in Chapter 9, event 5.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship between Joan calling Kazan and tending to his wounds is valid in terms of showing care. However, the claim of consistency is not fully supported by the outline, as it only provides two instances of care.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation, but the use of ""consistently"" is an assumption not explicitly stated in the summary or outline.

Since the claim of consistency is not fully supported by the provided information, the claim is INVALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""Joan consistently avoids Kazan"": There is no evidence in the chapter outline or book summary to support that Joan consistently avoids Kazan. In fact, the outline indicates that Joan interacts with Kazan, such as when she tells him they will be alone that night and plans to move away (Chapter 8, event 4).
    b. ""refusing to call him from her cabin"": This part is directly contradicted by Chapter 8, event 2, where a woman's voice calls for Kazan from a cabin.
    c. ""neglecting his wounds when he is injured"": This part is contradicted by Chapter 9, event 5, where Joan tends to Kazan's wounds at the cabin.

    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
