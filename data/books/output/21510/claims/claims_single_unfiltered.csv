    c. ""when a loud noise is heard from outside"": The outline does not mention a loud noise being heard from outside. It only mentions a bright light and Ape's voice through the communicator (event 7).

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not meaningful or valid because the atomic parts are not grounded in the chapter outline. The claim introduces details not present in the outline, such as the small room, single exit, active king plasmoid, and loud noise.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it introduces elements not supported by the provided information.

Since none of the atomic parts are grounded in the chapter outline, and the relationship between them is not meaningful or valid, the claim is INVALID."
