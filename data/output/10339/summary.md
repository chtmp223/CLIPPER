The narrative begins with the introduction of the schooner _Halbrane_, captained by Len Guy, a reserved man with a deep-seated secret. The ship is primarily used for trade in the southern seas, but it's heavily armed due to the threat of pirates. The story is set in motion when a passenger, Mr. Jeorling, a curious and adventurous American, seeks passage on the _Halbrane_ to leave the remote Kerguelen Islands.

Jeorling learns about Captain Len Guy's obsession with the fate of his brother, William Guy, the captain of the lost ship _Jane_, which disappeared in the Antarctic seas. The _Jane_ had previously rescued Arthur Gordon Pym and Dirk Peters, two characters from Edgar Allan Poe's narrative. Captain Len Guy believes his brother and some crew members might still be alive on the mysterious Tsalal Island, and he is determined to find them.

As the _Halbrane_ sails south, Jeorling becomes increasingly intrigued by the captain's mission and the possibility that Poe's narrative might be based on true events. The crew is skeptical but follows their captain, driven by loyalty and the promise of adventure. Along the way, they encounter various challenges, including navigating through treacherous icebergs and dealing with the harsh Antarctic climate.

The tension rises when the crew discovers a frozen body on a drifting iceberg, which turns out to be Patterson, the mate of the _Jane_. This discovery confirms the authenticity of the narrative and strengthens Captain Guy's resolve to continue the search. The _Halbrane_ eventually reaches the vicinity of Tsalal Island, where they find remnants of the _Jane_ and evidence that some of its crew might have survived.

The narrative takes a dramatic turn when a mutiny led by the sealing-master Hearne occurs. Hearne and some crew members attempt to seize the ship's only boat to escape back north, leaving the others stranded. However, their plan fails, and they are lost at sea. The remaining crew, including Jeorling, Captain Len Guy, and Dirk Peters, are left to fend for themselves in the harsh Antarctic environment.

As they continue their search, they come across a strange magnetic phenomenon that affects their navigation instruments and encounter a mysterious landmass resembling a sphinx. Here, they find a boat with the surviving members of the _Jane_, including William Guy. The reunion is bittersweet, as the harsh conditions have taken a toll on the survivors.

In the end, the crew of the _Halbrane_ and the survivors of the _Jane_ face the challenge of returning to civilization. Their journey is fraught with danger, but they are driven by the hope of survival and the desire to share their incredible story with the world. The narrative concludes with the acknowledgment that while many mysteries of the Antarctic remain unsolved, the courage and determination of explorers like Captain Len Guy and his crew continue to push the boundaries of human exploration.
