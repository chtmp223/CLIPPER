Hortense's character evolves from receiving a squirrel gift and exchanging songs to actively paddling with voyageurs and expressing her love for the wilderness.,Hortense's character evolves from actively paddling with voyageurs to receiving a squirrel gift and exchanging songs.,"This fact demonstrates Hortense's character development throughout the story. In Chapter 1, she receives a squirrel as a gift, suggesting a more passive role. In Chapter 3, she engages in a musical exchange, showing some assertiveness. By Chapter 21, she has become more adventurous, paddling with voyageurs and openly expressing her love for the wilderness.","This corrupted fact reverses the chronological order of events, misrepresenting Hortense's character development.","Chapters 1, 3, 21","- Chapter 1, item 5: Jack Battle brings a squirrel as a gift for Hortense.

- Relationship: Character development (Hortense)",Unique,Valid claim,INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Hortense's character evolves from receiving a squirrel gift and exchanging songs"": The chapter outline does not mention Hortense receiving a squirrel gift. However, it does mention the narrator singing a romantic madrigal to Hortense, who responds with a playful song of her own in Chapter 3, event 5. This suggests an exchange of songs, but the squirrel gift is not grounded in the provided outline.
   b. ""to actively paddling with voyageurs and expressing her love for the wilderness"": The chapter outline does not provide any information about Hortense paddling with voyageurs or explicitly expressing her love for the wilderness. However, Chapter 21, event 6, mentions Hortense arriving in the wilderness disguised as a page boy, which implies some level of engagement with the wilderness, but not necessarily paddling with voyageurs or expressing love for it.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship suggests a progression in Hortense's character from exchanging songs to engaging with the wilderness. However, the specific details of receiving a squirrel gift and paddling with voyageurs are not supported by the chapter outline.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
