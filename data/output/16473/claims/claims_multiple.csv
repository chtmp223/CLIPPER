2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:

    a. ""After discovering the fancy clothing and new books her mother packed for her"": This part is partially grounded in Chapter 3, event 2, where Hilda unpacks her trunk and discovers simple clothing and beloved books her mother packed for her.

    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not contradict any information in the summary or outline, but it is not explicitly supported by them either.

   a. ""Hilda's forget-me-not themed bedroom at home"": This part is grounded in event 2 of Chapter 1, where Hilda is described as sitting in her forget-me-not themed bedroom.
   b. ""is replaced by an equally ornate room at Hartley Farm"": There is no mention in the chapter outline or book summary of Hilda's room at Hartley Farm being ornate. In fact, the summary and outline suggest a simpler, rustic setting.
   c. ""where she discovers expensive clothing and new books packed by her mother"": The chapter outline for Chapter 3 mentions Hilda discovering simple clothing and beloved books packed by her mother, not expensive clothing or new books.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the claim inaccurately describes the room at Hartley Farm as ""equally ornate"" and the clothing as ""expensive,"" which contradicts the information provided in the chapter outline.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it misrepresents the nature of Hilda's room and belongings at Hartley Farm.
