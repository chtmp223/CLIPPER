In the unfolding narrative, we are introduced to John Lexman, a successful author of detective stories, who becomes embroiled in a real-life mystery that mirrors the plots of his novels. The story begins with Lexman returning home to Beston Priory, a quaint Elizabethan-style cottage, after a troubling day in London. He is preoccupied with a recent encounter with a Greek moneylender named Vassalaro, to whom he owes a significant sum due to a failed speculation in Roumanian gold shares.

Lexman is married to Grace, a brave and sweet woman, who is unaware of the full extent of her husband's financial troubles. The couple's peaceful life is further complicated by the presence of Remington Kara, a wealthy and enigmatic Greek who has a history with Grace. Kara had previously proposed to Grace during a tour in the Balkans, which she declined, leading to a tense and dangerous encounter that she has kept secret from her husband.

As the narrative progresses, Lexman receives a threatening letter from Vassalaro demanding an immediate payment under the threat of violence. Despite Kara's advice to confront Vassalaro with a revolver, Lexman is apprehensive about the meeting. The situation escalates when Lexman, in a moment of panic, shoots Vassalaro during their confrontation on a dark, rainy night. The Greek moneylender's death sets off a chain of events that lead to Lexman's arrest and conviction for murder, despite his claim of self-defense and the mysterious disappearance of Vassalaro's revolver.

T. X. Meredith, an Assistant Commissioner of Police and a friend of Lexman, becomes involved in the case. He is a sharp, intuitive detective, known for his unconventional methods and deep human sympathies. T. X. is determined to prove Lexman's innocence and uncover the truth behind the murder. His investigation reveals a complex web of intrigue involving Kara, who seems to have a sinister interest in Lexman's downfall.

Kara, described as a man of singular beauty and grace, is a figure shrouded in mystery and power. He is suspected of orchestrating events from behind the scenes, including Lexman's financial troubles and the subsequent murder charge. Kara's influence extends into high society, and he is rumored to have ambitions beyond his vast wealth, possibly seeking political power in Albania.

As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Kara's motivations are deeply personal and malicious. He harbors a grudge against Lexman for marrying Grace, the woman he desired, and uses his wealth and connections to manipulate the situation to his advantage. Kara's machinations are further revealed through his interactions with his secretary, Miss Holland, and his valet, Fisher, both of whom play crucial roles in the unfolding drama.

The narrative takes a dramatic turn when Lexman escapes from Dartmoor Prison with the help of Kara, who flies him to safety in a daring aeroplane rescue. This unexpected alliance raises questions about Kara's true intentions and the extent of his involvement in the murder plot. Meanwhile, T. X. continues to unravel the mystery, piecing together clues that suggest Kara's culpability in a broader conspiracy.

The climax of the story is reached when Grace Lexman, believed to be dead, is revealed to be alive and in hiding. Her reappearance is orchestrated by Belinda Mary, a young woman of remarkable resourcefulness and courage, who has been working secretly to protect Grace and uncover Kara's schemes. The revelation of Grace's survival and the evidence gathered by T. X. lead to a dramatic confrontation with Kara, who is exposed as the mastermind behind the plot against Lexman.

In the end, justice is served as Kara's crimes are brought to light, and Lexman's name is cleared. The story concludes with the promise of a new beginning for John and Grace Lexman, free from the shadows of the past and ready to embrace a future together. Through a blend of mystery, intrigue, and human drama, the narrative explores themes of love, revenge, and redemption, set against the backdrop of a society where power and wealth often dictate the course of justice.
