Ellen, a curious and imaginative young girl, embarks on an unexpected journey when she discovers a hidden world behind the nursery bookcase. Her adventure begins on a rainy day as she muses over a forgotten story her grandmother used to tell about a princess named Goldenlocks. Ellen's grandmother often forgets the story's ending, leaving Ellen with an insatiable curiosity to find the missing pieces.

Her quest takes her through the bookcase into a magical realm where she encounters a circular hall filled with arches and a dome that sparkles like the night sky. Here, she meets a gatekeeper who is initially surprised by her presence but eventually allows her to explore the world of the Queerbodies, a place where forgotten stories and rhymes reside. Ellen learns that these stories are often remade into new tales, and she hopes to find the forgotten story of Goldenlocks to share with her grandmother.

As Ellen navigates this fantastical world, she is joined by a magical gander from Mother Goose, who offers to help her travel across the land. Along the way, Ellen encounters various characters from nursery rhymes and fairy tales, including a boy who rides a magic pig and a group of mischievous dwarfs. She also faces challenges, such as escaping from a fierce gray wolf and outsmarting a dragon that guards the entrance to the Queerbodies' domain.

Ellen's journey is not without peril, as she finds herself trapped in a room with Aladdin's magic lamp, guarded by suspicious soldiers. With the help of her gander and the genie of the lamp, she escapes, ultimately choosing to destroy the lamp to free the genie and ensure Aladdin's safety.

Her adventure culminates in a mysterious desert where she meets a lad who resembles her gardener's son. He assists her in crossing the barren landscape by magically enlarging her wooden toy pig into a rideable companion. Together, they navigate past the dragon and reach the heavily barred door of the Queerbodies' house. Here, Ellen uses a magic key given to her by Fatima, a character from the story of Bluebeard, to unlock the door and finally enter the realm where forgotten stories are kept.

Throughout her journey, Ellen's determination to find the forgotten story of Goldenlocks is driven by her desire to bring joy to her grandmother. Her encounters with various characters teach her about bravery, kindness, and the power of imagination. In the end, Ellen's adventure not only fulfills her quest but also enriches her understanding of the magical world of stories and the importance of preserving them.
