   d. ""leading Steele and the narrator to ambush them when they return to free their accomplices"": This part is grounded in event 3 of Chapter 5, where Steele and the narrator ambush Bass and Miller when they return to free their accomplices.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:

   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly grounded in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it aligns with the ongoing efforts of Steele and the narrator to combat criminal activities in Linrock.

Since all atomic parts are grounded in the chapter outline, and the relationship between them is valid and meaningful, the claim is consistent with the provided information.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""After capturing Sim Bass and Miller at Miss Sampson's house"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. Sim Bass and Miller are not mentioned in Chapter 4, which is set at Miss Sampson's house. Instead, Bo Snecker is captured there.
   b. ""Steele arrests Bo Snecker for robbery"": This part is partially grounded in Chapter 4, where Bo Snecker is captured, but there is no mention of him being arrested for robbery.
   c. ""but he escapes from the makeshift jail"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The escape from the makeshift jail is associated with Sim Bass and Miller in Chapter 5, not Bo Snecker.
   d. ""leading Steele and the narrator to ambush him when he returns to free his accomplices"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The ambush is related to Sim Bass and Miller, not Bo Snecker.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid because the sequence of events described in the claim does not match the events in the chapter outline. The claim incorrectly combines events related to different characters.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it mixes up characters and events.

Since the atomic parts are not grounded in the chapter outline and the relationship between them is not valid, the claim is INVALID."

Later, in Chapter 13, Morton meets with Sittell and Zimmer at the hall, where he shares information about Snecker's presence at the Hope So saloon. This sequence of events demonstrates Morton's ongoing involvement in the efforts against the rustlers, from direct pursuit to information sharing.","The corrupted fact misrepresents Morton's actions and the information shared, stating that he avoided the gunfight and met with Snecker instead of Sittell, which contradicts the information provided in the outline.","Chapter 11, 13","- Chapter 11, item 5: The fight spills into the street, with Morton and his group pursuing rustlers in various directions.
