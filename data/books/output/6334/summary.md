Sara Olmstead, a young girl with a passion for books, lives in the small fishing village of Killamet. Her father, Reuben Olmstead, a fisherman, is preparing for an upcoming fishing trip, leaving Sara to help manage the household. Sara's mother died years ago, and her stepmother, though well-meaning, often clashes with Sara over her love for reading. Sara is responsible for her younger siblings, including the baby, and she cherishes the memory of her year at the Weskisset Seminary as a time of growth and learning.

Sara's father, Reuben, is a kind and hardworking man who promised his dying wife to ensure Sara received a good education. Despite financial hardships, he has always supported Sara's educational pursuits. However, with the fishing season approaching, Sara is reminded of the harsh realities of life in Killamet. The village is small, with a close-knit community that often gossips about each other, and Sara feels the pressure of societal expectations.

She finds solace in her books and the natural surroundings of Killamet, often exploring the cliffs and beaches while collecting shells and rocks. Her love for learning and nature is evident as she shares her knowledge with her siblings, instilling in them a curiosity about the world.

Despite the challenges, Sara remains hopeful and determined. Her encounter with Madame Grandet, a visitor to Killamet, introduces her to the concept of being a "King's Daughter," a member of a society dedicated to doing good deeds. This inspires Sara to strive for a higher purpose, even as she faces the daily struggles of poverty and responsibility.

As the story progresses, Sara receives news of her father's death at sea, a devastating blow that leaves her feeling lost and overwhelmed. The family's financial situation becomes dire, and Sara must navigate the challenges of providing for her siblings. However, a fortuitous discovery of hidden money in a broken mirror offers temporary relief and a renewed sense of hope.

Throughout the narrative, Sara's resilience and strength are tested, but she remains steadfast in her commitment to her family and her dreams. Her interactions with the Grandet family and their nephew, Robert Glendenning, open new possibilities for Sara, as she finds herself drawn to Robert's kindness and understanding.

As the story unfolds, Sara must confront her fears and insecurities, ultimately finding her place in the world as she embraces the love and support of those around her. The tale of Sara Olmstead is one of growth, perseverance, and the enduring power of love and family in the face of adversity.
