Relationship: Jefferson Hope's involvement with Lucy Ferrier",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Jefferson Hope's relationship with Lucy Ferrier progresses from rescuing her from a dangerous cattle drive"": This part is grounded in Chapter 9, where Jefferson Hope rescues Lucy from a cattle drive and subsequently visits the Ferrier farm multiple times, becoming close with John and Lucy.
   b. ""to secretly planning her escape from the Mormons"": This part is grounded in Chapter 11, where Jefferson Hope arrives at Ferrier's house in secret and plans their escape from the Mormons.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The progression from a rescue to planning an escape indicates a deepening of their relationship, which is consistent with the narrative of Hope becoming close to Lucy and eventually planning to marry her.

There is no mention of Hope planning Lucy's wedding to a Mormon suitor.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
