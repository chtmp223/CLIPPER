   a. ""After transporting the treasure from the cave to the Hispaniola over several days"": This part is grounded in event 1 of Chapter 34, where the crew transports the treasure from the cave to the beach and then to the Hispaniola over several days.
   b. ""the ship immediately returns to Bristol without stopping at any ports"": This part contradicts event 5 of Chapter 34, where it is stated that the Hispaniola reaches a Spanish American port to recruit new crew members and resupply before returning to Bristol.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid because the claim incorrectly states that the ship returns to Bristol without stopping at any ports, which contradicts the chapter outline.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation but rather a factual error based on the provided information.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it contradicts the events described.

Since the second atomic part contradicts the chapter outline, the claim is INVALID."
The crew's decision to abandon the three remaining mutineers on the island with supplies leads to the mutineers pleading to be taken aboard as the Hispaniola sets sail.,The crew's decision to abandon the three remaining mutineers on the island without supplies leads to the mutineers attacking the Hispaniola as it sets sail.,The chapter outline presents a clear cause-and-effect relationship between these two events. The crew's decision to leave the mutineers behind (item 3) directly results in the mutineers' desperate pleas as the ship departs (item 4). This fact combines these two closely related events to show the immediate consequences of the crew's decision.,This corrupted fact contradicts both items 3 and 4.
