In a northern home, two children, Sagastaookemou ("Sunrise Gentleman") and Minnehaha ("Laughing Waters"), are gently taken by two pagan Saulteaux Indians, Souwanas and Jakoos, to a wigwam near Lake Winnipeg. The children, familiar and unafraid of the Indians, enjoy a feast with other native children. This novel experience includes wild ducks, rabbits, and partridges cooked over a fire, a stark contrast to their usual meals. The day is filled with storytelling, and Souwanas, known as a storyteller, captivates them with tales of Nanahboozhoo, a mythical figure capable of shape-shifting and leaving marks on nature. One story explains why the birch tree is scarred and why the raccoon has rings on its tail, attributing these features to Nanahboozhoo's adventures and mishaps.

As winter approaches, the arrival of the Christmas packet brings excitement and gifts to the mission, even in the harsh cold. The children, Sagastao and Minnehaha, eagerly share their gifts with Souwanas, who reciprocates with stories. One tale recounts how Nanahboozhoo helped the Ojibways learn to make maple sugar, a sweet story fitting the children's request. The narrative includes Nanahboozhoo's cleverness in overcoming challenges and aiding the tribes, despite his mischievous nature.

In another chapter, Sagastao, recovering from illness, inquires about the origin of sickness. Mary, the children's nurse, promises to tell him the legend once he's stronger. The story unfolds with animals holding councils to decide how to retaliate against humans for their cruelty, resulting in diseases. Bears, deer, fish, snakes, birds, and insects each decide on a unique way to afflict humans, explaining various ailments and fears. This tale illustrates the interconnectedness and ancient beliefs of the natural world.

The narrative continues with a naming ceremony for the children's baby sister, born among the Saulteaux. After much deliberation, the tribe names her Souwanaquenapeke, meaning "The Voice of the South Wind Birds," honoring her birthplace and the spring season. Later, during a canoe trip, Mary tells the children about the discovery of medicine, attributed to the ground squirrel, who revealed healing plants to humans after animals sent diseases among them. This story underscores the theme of gratitude and respect for nature's gifts.

Souwanas shares a tale of Waubenoo, a kind-hearted maiden pursued by the cruel Gray Wolf. Nanahboozhoo, disguised, aids her by teaching Gray Wolf a lesson, highlighting themes of bravery and justice. In a subsequent story, Waubenoo is transformed into a bird, the Whisky Jack, after Gray Wolf's treachery is revealed, illustrating the consequences of deceit and the enduring spirit of kindness.

The children's curiosity leads to a story about the wolverine, whose legs were shortened after a race with a rock, symbolizing the punishment for conceit. Another tale reveals how twin children of the Sun rid the earth of monsters, showcasing bravery and the triumph of good over evil. As spring arrives, Souwanas recounts how Nanahboozhoo destroyed a great sea monster, Mooshekinnebik, bringing safety to the people and demonstrating his heroic nature.

In the summer, the children learn about Nanahboozhoo's adventures, including his ride on a buzzard that ends with a fall, explaining why the buzzard has no feathers on its head. This humorous tale contrasts with the more serious legend of an orphan boy saved by the man in the moon, emphasizing themes of resilience and self-reliance.

Souwanas's fondness for the children is evident as he shares stories, including how Nanahboozhoo cured a snakebite and lessened the rattlesnake's threat. The origin of tobacco is also attributed to Nanahboozhoo's cunning, reflecting his complex character. As the seasons change, the children delight in these stories, which blend humor, morality, and cultural heritage, enriching their understanding of the world and the myths that shape it.
