In an unfashionable part of London, a committee of six women, including Miss Meta Mostyn Ford and Lady Arabel Higgins, is gathered to discuss War Savings. Their meeting is interrupted by a young woman who bursts in, claiming she is being pursued for stealing a bun. This stranger, who calls herself Angela, reveals that she has donated all her money to the War Loan, leaving her penniless. The women are skeptical, but Angela's receipt confirms her story. She is a witch, and her presence begins to disrupt the committee's orderly existence.

Angela's true nature is revealed through her interactions with the committee and her magical antics. She is later joined by Sarah Brown, a woman struggling with ill health and a mundane job at a charity office. Sarah's life changes when she meets the witch and becomes entangled in a series of magical events, including an air raid where Angela battles a German witch in the sky. After the battle, Angela lands in Kensington Gardens, where she concocts a healing charm for her wounds.

Meanwhile, Sarah Brown, dealing with her own challenges, finds solace in the witch's magic. She becomes involved in the witch's world, experiencing the enchantment of the Faery Farm, where she works alongside fairies and encounters Richard Higgins, a wizard and Lady Arabel's son. Richard offers Sarah a job at his farm, and they form a connection as they travel through the Enchanted Forest.

The story unfolds with a mix of magical and mundane elements, including a humorous scene at Miss Ford's Wednesday gathering, where the witch inadvertently causes chaos. The narrative explores themes of magic, war, and the struggle between the ordinary and the extraordinary. Characters like the Mayor, who proposes to Angela, and Peony, who has her own mystical experiences, add depth to the tale.

As the witch's influence spreads, the House of Living Alone becomes a focal point for those seeking escape from societal norms. However, the house is eventually destroyed in a magical fire, symbolizing the transient nature of magic and the impermanence of sanctuary. Richard reveals to his mother, Lady Arabel, that she is now a grandmother to a faery child named Elbert, born to his True Love, Peony.

Ultimately, the story is a whimsical exploration of the intersection between magic and reality, where characters navigate their desires, fears, and destinies in a world that is both fantastical and deeply human. The witch, Angela, embodies the spirit of rebellion against the mundane, offering a glimpse into the possibilities of living beyond conventional boundaries.
