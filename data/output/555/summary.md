Francesca Bassington, once known as the beautiful Miss Greech, is a woman in her forties living in Blue Street, London. Her drawing-room, filled with precious possessions and mementos of past successes, is a reflection of her soul. Despite her apparent good fortune, Francesca's life is marked by a series of disappointments and unfulfilled potential. Her main worry is the future of her beloved house, which she only holds until her friend Sophie Chetrof's niece, Emmeline, marries. Francesca hopes that her son, Comus, will marry Emmeline, thereby securing her place in the house.

Comus Bassington, Francesca's son, is a charming but irresponsible young man, well-known for his mischief and lack of seriousness. Francesca's brother, Henry Greech, is a reliable but dull politician who provides financial support and advice to Francesca. Comus, however, is a constant source of worry, as he shows little inclination to find a suitable career or settle down.

As the story unfolds, Francesca becomes increasingly anxious about Comus's future and her own security. She pins her hopes on Comus marrying Elaine de Frey, a wealthy heiress. However, Comus's irresponsible behavior, including borrowing money from Elaine, jeopardizes this plan. Meanwhile, Courtenay Youghal, a young and ambitious politician, also shows interest in Elaine, complicating matters further.

Elaine is torn between Comus's charm and Youghal's promising career. Despite Comus's shortcomings, Elaine is fond of him but becomes increasingly frustrated with his selfishness and lack of ambition. Comus, meanwhile, remains oblivious to the seriousness of his situation and continues to behave recklessly.

Francesca's hopes are dashed when she learns that Elaine has chosen Youghal over Comus. This decision not only affects Comus's prospects but also threatens Francesca's future in the house on Blue Street. In a moment of despair, Francesca reflects on her life and the choices she has made, realizing too late the depth of her love for her son.

The narrative shifts to Comus's experience in West Africa, where he has been sent to find a career. Isolated and disillusioned, Comus reflects on his past and the choices that led him to his current situation. He realizes that he has squandered his opportunities and that his fate is sealed.

Back in London, Francesca receives the devastating news of Comus's death. Overcome with grief, she is left to confront the emptiness of her life without her son. Her cherished possessions, once a source of comfort, now seem hollow and meaningless.

The story concludes with Francesca's realization that she has lost the most important thing in her life, and she is left to face an uncertain future alone, haunted by memories of what might have been.
