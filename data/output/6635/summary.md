In the springtime of Kentucky, the Carsey family estate, Thornwood, stands as a monument to past prosperity amidst the encroaching city. Colonel Bob Carsey, the current patriarch, enjoys a leisurely afternoon on the porch, reflecting on the estate's glory days. His daughter, Miss Lady, a spirited young woman with a zest for life, interrupts his reverie. Despite Colonel Carsey's initial disapproval, Miss Lady plans to go riding with Don Morley, a young man looking to buy a farm nearby.

As the narrative unfolds, we learn of the Carsey family's history and the estate's decline. Miss Lady, raised by her father after her mother's death, has an adventurous spirit and a love for the outdoors. Her education has been unconventional, and she resists the constraints of societal expectations, preferring to learn in her own way.

Miss Lady's life takes a turn when she becomes acquainted with Doctor John Jay Queerington, a serious and respected academic who has been recuperating at Thornwood. Despite the age difference, Queerington proposes to Miss Lady, and she, seeking purpose and stability, agrees to marry him.

The marriage introduces Miss Lady to a life of intellectual pursuits and societal obligations, but she struggles with the constraints of her new role. Her youthful energy and love for the outdoors clash with the expectations of her husband's world. Despite her efforts to adapt, she feels increasingly isolated and homesick.

Meanwhile, Donald Morley faces his own challenges. He is wrongly implicated in a shooting incident involving Lee Dillingham, a member of a prominent family. Donald's decision to stand trial to clear his name is met with skepticism by many, including his sister, Mrs. Sequin, who fears the scandal's impact on her family's reputation.

As Donald's trial approaches, Miss Lady finds herself drawn into his plight. She learns of his plans to face the charges and is moved by his determination to prove his innocence. Her loyalty to him is complicated by her own feelings and the expectations of her marriage.

The trial becomes a focal point for the community, with opinions divided on Donald's guilt. Miss Lady, despite her personal turmoil, supports Donald, believing in his innocence. Her relationship with Doctor Queerington also evolves, as he provides her with guidance and support during this tumultuous time.

As the trial unfolds, new evidence comes to light, and Donald's innocence is eventually established. Miss Lady's faith in him is vindicated, and she gains a deeper understanding of herself and her desires. The resolution of the trial brings a sense of closure and new beginnings for both Donald and Miss Lady.
