   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline. The summary and outline do not provide a direct comparison or evolution of perception from barren to quaint.
   c. The relationship does not contradict any information in the summary or outline, but it lacks explicit support for the initial perception of barrenness.
