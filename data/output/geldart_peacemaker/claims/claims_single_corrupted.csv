    b. ""immediately asks to speak with Emilie alone"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The outline states that Joe asks to speak with John alone, not Emilie (event 3).

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not meaningful or valid because both atomic parts are incorrect based on the chapter outline.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as both parts of the claim are incorrect.

Since both atomic parts are not grounded in the chapter outline and the relationship is not meaningful, the claim is INVALID."
