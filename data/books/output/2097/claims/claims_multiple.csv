- Chapter 12, item 2: Small describes forming a pact with three Sikh prisoners to retrieve and share the treasure, which they successfully acquire.
- Relationship: Connection between the murder and the original pact",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. The note with ""The sign of the four"" found at Bartholomew Sholto's murder scene: This part is grounded in event 6 of Chapter 5, where Holmes identifies a note with ""The sign of the four"" at the murder scene.
    b. Refers to the pact formed between Jonathan Small and three Sikh prisoners to retrieve and share the Agra treasure: This part is grounded in event 2 of Chapter 12, where Jonathan Small describes forming a pact with three Sikh prisoners to retrieve and share the treasure.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The note with ""The sign of the four"" is directly related to the pact formed by Jonathan Small and the three Sikh prisoners, as it serves as a signature or symbol of their agreement and subsequent actions.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly grounded in the chapter outline, where the note and the pact are both mentioned.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the note serves as a clue to the identity and motives of the murderer, Jonathan Small, who was part of the pact.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""The note with 'The sign of the four' found at Bartholomew Sholto's murder scene"": This part is grounded in event 6 of Chapter 5, where Holmes identifies a note with ""The sign of the four"" at the murder scene.
   b. ""refers to the pact formed between Major Sholto and three Sikh prisoners to retrieve and share the Agra treasure"": This part is not directly grounded in the chapter outline. In Chapter 12, Jonathan Small explains the pact he formed with three Sikh prisoners, but there is no mention of Major Sholto being part of this pact. Instead, Major Sholto and Captain Morstan discover Small's secret and make a deal to help the prisoners escape in exchange for the treasure's location, which is a separate agreement.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the note with ""The sign of the four"" does not directly refer to a pact involving Major Sholto. The note is more likely a message of revenge left by Jonathan Small, as indicated in Chapter 12, event 6.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the note is associated with Jonathan Small's actions and not a pact involving Major Sholto.

Since 1b., 2a., and 2b. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
