In a futuristic narrative spanning multiple generations, the story unfolds through the perspective of Julian 5th, a descendant of a line of military men, who recounts his adventures in the 22nd century and his connection to Mars. Julian 5th, born in the year 2000, follows a legacy of military service, joining the International Peace Fleet at sixteen. Despite a century of peace enforced by the fleet, a new calamity emerges from Mars, a planet with which Earth has been in communication since 1967. This connection, facilitated by the legendary John Carter, leads to an exchange of knowledge and technology between the two planets.

The narrative shifts to the year 2025, when a Martian ship, lost in space, prompts Earth to attempt interplanetary travel. Julian 5th commands a ship, The Barsoom, on a mission to Mars. However, Lieutenant Commander Orthis, a brilliant yet unscrupulous officer, sabotages the mission, causing the ship to drift towards the Moon. Julian 5th and his crew, including Orthis, are forced to make a landing on the Moon, where they discover an atmosphere and a habitable environment within its hollow interior.

Inside the Moon, they encounter the Va-gas, a savage race of quadrupeds, and the U-ga, a more advanced humanoid species. Julian 5th befriends Nah-ee-lah, a princess of the U-ga, who is captured by the Va-gas. Together, they escape and navigate the perilous lunar landscape, seeking the hidden city of Laythe, Nah-ee-lah's home. Along the way, they face dangers from the Va-gas, the Kalkars—a hostile race—and the natural hazards of the Moon.

Julian 5th's journey is fraught with challenges, including a battle with a tor-ho, a fierce lunar creature, and the constant threat of capture by the Kalkars. Despite these obstacles, Julian and Nah-ee-lah form a strong bond, united by their struggle for survival and mutual respect. As they traverse the Moon's interior, Julian grapples with the realization that he may never return to Earth, finding solace in his growing affection for Nah-ee-lah.

The story explores themes of loyalty, bravery, and the enduring human spirit in the face of adversity. Julian 5th's narrative is a testament to the resilience of the human heart, as he navigates a world filled with unknown perils and discovers the true meaning of companionship and love. The tale concludes with Julian and Nah-ee-lah's continued search for Laythe, leaving their ultimate fate open to the imagination.
