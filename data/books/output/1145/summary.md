The story unfolds in the fictional European country of Ruritania, where political intrigue and personal vendettas intertwine. The narrative begins with the return of Rudolf Rassendyll to Ruritania, a man who once impersonated the king, Rudolf V, due to their uncanny resemblance. This time, Rudolf is drawn back into the country's affairs due to a letter written by Queen Flavia, which falls into the hands of the treacherous Count Rupert of Hentzau.

Rudolf's mission is to retrieve the letter, which could ruin the queen's reputation if it reaches the king. The letter was stolen by Rupert, a cunning and ruthless adversary, who is aided by his cousin, the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim. Rassendyll's allies include Colonel Sapt, the loyal constable of Zenda, and Fritz von Tarlenheim, a nobleman devoted to the queen.

As Rudolf navigates the dangerous political landscape, he encounters numerous obstacles. Rischenheim attempts to deliver the letter to the king, but Rudolf and Sapt intercept him. They manage to steal a copy of the letter from Rischenheim but fail to capture Rupert, who remains a looming threat.

The plot thickens when the king, unaware of the letter's existence, decides to spend time at a hunting lodge. This decision coincides with Rupert's plan to meet the king and use the letter as leverage. However, a series of events leads to the king's accidental death at the hands of Rupert, who is forced to kill him in self-defense during a confrontation.

With the king dead and Rupert still at large, Rassendyll and his allies must act quickly to prevent the letter from being exposed. They decide to keep the king's death a secret temporarily, hoping to capture Rupert and retrieve the letter before the truth comes out. Meanwhile, Queen Flavia, driven by a recurring dream and a sense of foreboding, travels to Strelsau, unaware of the king's fate.

The narrative culminates in a tense game of cat and mouse between Rassendyll and Rupert. Rassendyll's mission is complicated by the queen's presence in the capital and the need to maintain the illusion that the king is still alive. The story explores themes of duty, honor, and the personal sacrifices made for love and country.

Ultimately, the characters are driven by their loyalty to the queen and the desire to protect her honor, even at great personal risk. The story ends with a reflection on the consequences of their actions and the enduring legacy of Rudolf Rassendyll, whose courage and cunning continue to inspire those who knew him.
