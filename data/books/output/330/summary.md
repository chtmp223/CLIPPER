In a tale of intrigue, mistaken identities, and unexpected alliances, the story unfolds at Hope Springs Sanatorium, a once-thriving health resort now on the brink of collapse. The narrative begins with the death of the old doctor, the sanatorium's guiding force, leaving the establishment in a precarious position. The will reveals that the sanatorium is left to the doctor's grandson, Richard "Dick" Carter, with the condition that he must successfully manage it for two months. However, Dick is nowhere to be found, having disappeared on his way to the sanatorium.

Minnie, the long-time spring-house girl, finds herself at the center of the ensuing chaos. She is determined to save the sanatorium from the clutches of Thoburn, a businessman eager to convert it into a summer hotel. With Dick missing, Minnie and Mr. Van Alstyne, Dick's brother-in-law, hatch a desperate plan to pass off Alan Pierce, a stranded young man who bears a resemblance to Dick, as the heir. Pierce, who is down on his luck after a failed theatrical venture, agrees to the ruse, seeing it as an opportunity to find shelter and sustenance.

As Pierce assumes Dick's identity, he navigates the complexities of managing the sanatorium, dealing with its eccentric guests, and maintaining the façade. Among the guests is Miss Patty Jennings, a young woman of high social standing, engaged to a European prince. Patty is caught in her own web of familial expectations and personal desires, and her interactions with Pierce become increasingly significant as the story progresses.

Complicating matters further, the real Dick Carter arrives secretly with his new wife, Dorothy, Patty's younger sister. They hide in the shelter-house on the golf links, adding another layer of deception. Dorothy, a schoolgirl who eloped with Dick, fears her father's reaction and relies on Patty to help manage the situation.

Throughout the narrative, the characters grapple with their circumstances—Minnie with her loyalty to the sanatorium, Pierce with his growing affection for Patty, and Patty with her impending marriage and family obligations. The tension culminates in a clandestine supper organized by Thoburn, aiming to undermine Pierce's authority and disrupt the sanatorium's new regime.

The story is rich with themes of love, honor, and the struggle between personal desires and social expectations. It explores the lengths to which individuals will go to protect what they cherish and the unexpected alliances that form in times of crisis. As the characters navigate their intertwined fates, they discover new facets of themselves, leading to a resolution that balances the demands of duty with the pursuit of happiness.
