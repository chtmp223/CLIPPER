In a small desert town on the Mojave, a mysterious prospector has been searching the northern hills for gold for five years. To the townspeople, he's just another "desert rat," a term for those obsessed with finding gold. The harsh desert has aged him prematurely, and he's haunted by memories of a child and the child's mother. Voices in the desert whisper promises of lost gold, which he eventually finds. However, he realizes the dream of gold was more fulfilling than its possession, which leaves him feeling isolated and fearful. He yearns for human connection, especially with his child, whom he left behind ten years ago.

In the desert town, men speculate about the prospector's success with gold. Some plot to discover and seize his find. Meanwhile, William Stanley Winthrop, an Easterner, wakes in Los Angeles, reminiscing about a story he heard from a tramp named Overland Red about lost gold in the Mojave Desert. Intrigued, Winthrop decides to venture into the desert, despite knowing the tale might be a fabrication. He takes a train to the desert town, where he meets Jim Hicks, the constable, who offers to guide him. Winthrop, however, is more interested in finding Overland Red.

Overland Red, a seasoned adventurer, is indeed in the desert, hiding from the law. He meets Winthrop, who has come out of curiosity and a desire for adventure. They form an unlikely partnership. Winthrop is drawn into Overland Red's world, where the boundaries between reality and legend blur. They navigate the desert's challenges, seeking the elusive gold while evading those who would claim it for themselves.

Back at the Moonstone Ranch, Louise Lacharme, a vibrant and independent young woman, is admired by the ranch hands for her interest in ranch work. Collie, a young cowboy, is particularly taken with her. The ranch's foreman, Brand Williams, is wary of a new hand, Silent Saunders, suspecting he has ulterior motives. Saunders, it turns out, is connected to a group interested in Overland Red's gold.

Collie, who has a knack for breaking horses, earns the respect of the ranch hands. He is determined to prove himself, especially to Louise. During a barbecue at a neighboring ranch, Collie rides and tames an outlaw horse, earning the admiration of his peers and Louise. However, his success is overshadowed by the knowledge that Silent Saunders is a threat to Overland Red.

As tensions rise, Overland Red and Winthrop continue their quest, aware that Saunders and his men are closing in. Overland Red's past as a gunman and his knowledge of the desert give him an edge, but the danger is real. The story intertwines the lives of these characters, each driven by their own desires and fears, culminating in a dramatic showdown in the desert.

Through the trials and tribulations, Louise and Collie's relationship deepens, marked by moments of tenderness and understanding. Overland Red's influence on Collie is profound, teaching him about loyalty and the harsh realities of life. In the end, the search for gold becomes secondary to the bonds formed and the lessons learned in the unforgiving desert landscape.
