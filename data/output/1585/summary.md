The narrative begins with a reflection on the arduous labors of authors, likening the process to the intricate and often thankless task of crafting a narrative that entertains readers. The story then shifts focus to a tontineâ€”a financial arrangement where participants invest money, with the last surviving member receiving the accumulated sum. Joseph Finsbury and his brother Masterman were enrolled in such a tontine as children, and as the years passed, the number of surviving participants dwindled, leaving only a few, including the Finsbury brothers.

By the time the story unfolds, Masterman is elderly and ailing, living in seclusion with his son Michael, a solicitor. Joseph, though slightly younger, is more active but considered eccentric and irresponsible, having squandered his life in idleness and frivolous pursuits. He becomes the guardian of his nephews, Morris and John, after the death of his brother Jacob, and also takes in Julia Hazeltine, the daughter of a friend. Joseph invests the children's inheritance in a failing leather business, which Morris attempts to manage.

Morris, driven by desperation to reclaim his financial stability, becomes embroiled in a series of misadventures. He plans to declare his uncle Joseph dead to claim the tontine, but complications arise when a barrel containing a body, meant to be disposed of discreetly, goes missing. Morris's attempts to retrieve the situation lead him into a web of deceit and potential criminality, as he grapples with the moral and practical implications of his actions.

Meanwhile, Michael Finsbury, Joseph's son, is portrayed as a clever but morally ambiguous character who becomes entangled in the unfolding drama. He is approached by Morris for help, but the interactions between the two are marked by suspicion and manipulation. Michael's motivations remain unclear, adding to the tension and complexity of the narrative.

The story weaves through a series of farcical and darkly humorous events, involving mistaken identities, forged documents, and the ever-present threat of exposure. Characters such as Gideon Forsyth, a young barrister, and Mr. Pitman, a hapless artist, are drawn into the chaos, each contributing to the escalating confusion and comedic elements of the plot.

As the narrative progresses, the characters' schemes begin to unravel. Morris's attempts to cover up his actions and secure the tontine money are thwarted by unforeseen complications and the unpredictable behavior of those around him. The story reaches a climax as the truth about the tontine and the various deceptions is gradually revealed, leading to a resolution that underscores the themes of greed, folly, and the unpredictable nature of human endeavors.

Overall, the narrative is a satirical exploration of human ambition and the lengths to which individuals will go to secure wealth and status, often at the expense of morality and common sense. The characters' interactions and the convoluted plot serve as a commentary on the absurdity and complexity of life, with the tontine serving as both a catalyst for the action and a metaphor for the elusive nature of fortune.
