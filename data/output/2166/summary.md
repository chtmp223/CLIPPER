The narrative begins with Allan Quatermain, a seasoned hunter and trader based in Durban, Natal, who is approached by Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good. They seek Quatermain's expertise to help locate Sir Henry's brother, George Neville, who disappeared while searching for the legendary Solomon's Mines. Quatermain, initially reluctant due to the dangers involved, is persuaded by Curtis's generous offer and the promise to secure his son's future.

The journey commences from Durban, with the group traveling by wagon through the African wilderness. They face numerous challenges, including the treacherous tsetse fly-infested regions, which force them to abandon their wagon and proceed on foot. Along the way, they recruit Umbopa, a mysterious and dignified Zulu, as their guide and servant. Umbopa's presence becomes increasingly significant as the story unfolds.

As they venture deeper into the unknown, the group encounters various wildlife and faces the harsh realities of the African landscape. A notable adventure includes a dangerous elephant hunt, during which they witness the brutal realities of survival in the wild. The journey tests their endurance and resourcefulness, but they press on, driven by the hope of discovering the fabled mines and locating Neville.

Their path leads them to Kukuanaland, a mysterious and isolated kingdom surrounded by mountains. They are guided by Infadoos, a Kukuana chief, who reveals the kingdom's rich history and its connection to the ancient mines. The travelers learn of the tyrannical King Twala, who seized the throne by murdering his twin brother, the rightful king. Twala's rule is marked by cruelty and fear, enforced by the witch doctress Gagool.

Upon reaching Twala's capital, Loo, the group witnesses the king's brutal justice and the awe-inspiring power he wields over his people. Quatermain and his companions are introduced to the court, where they must navigate the dangerous political landscape. They learn of the annual witch-hunt, a gruesome event where suspected traitors are executed to maintain Twala's reign of terror.

As they gain the trust of Infadoos and the people, the travelers discover that Umbopa is, in fact, Ignosi, the rightful heir to the Kukuana throne. Ignosi reveals his true identity and his intention to overthrow Twala, with the support of Quatermain, Curtis, and Good. The group becomes embroiled in a civil war, leading to a climactic battle where Twala is defeated, and Ignosi ascends to the throne.

With Ignosi's help, the group gains access to Solomon's Mines, hidden within the mountains. They navigate through treacherous passages and encounter the chilling remains of previous explorers, including the mummified body of Jos√© da Silvestra, who left behind a map that guided them. Inside the treasure chamber, they find an unimaginable wealth of diamonds and gold.

Their victory, however, is marred by tragedy. Foulata, a beautiful Kukuana woman who had grown close to Good, is fatally wounded by Gagool during their escape from the mines. The group narrowly escapes being trapped forever, as the treasure chamber seals itself, leaving behind the riches they can never fully claim.

Returning to the surface, the travelers are hailed as heroes. Ignosi honors his promise to Quatermain and his friends, ensuring their safe passage back to civilization. They leave Kukuanaland with a modest share of diamonds, enough to secure their futures. The journey back is arduous, but they eventually reach Durban, where they part ways with Ignosi, now a wise and just ruler.

The narrative concludes with Quatermain reflecting on the adventure, the bonds formed, and the sacrifices made. Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good return to England, while Quatermain considers his future, enriched not only by the diamonds but by the experiences and friendships forged in the heart of Africa.
