- Relationship: The state of the Time Machine and its components",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""Despite the Time Traveller's precaution of removing the levers from the Time Machine to prevent accidental activation"": This part is grounded in event 2 of Chapter 5, where the Time Traveller removes the levers from the Time Machine.
    b. ""he later discovers it cleaned, oiled, and fully functional inside the White Sphinx"": This part is grounded in event 5 of Chapter 13, where the Time Traveller finds the Time Machine cleaned and oiled inside the White Sphinx.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is meaningful and valid. The claim highlights a contrast between the Time Traveller's initial precaution and the later state of the Time Machine, suggesting an unexpected development.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is based on the sequence of events described in the chapter outlines.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it reflects the progression of the narrative where the Time Traveller's initial actions are contrasted with later discoveries.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID."

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The progression from hinting at the machine to showing it and then using it to travel through time is a logical sequence of events.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline and supported by the book summary.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it follows the narrative of the Time Traveller's actions and experiences.
