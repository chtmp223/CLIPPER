- Relationship: Contrast",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""The chapter concludes with the news of the Duchess of Saint-Maclou's upcoming marriage to Gustave de Berensac"": This part is grounded in event 7 of Chapter 22.
    b. ""while simultaneously revealing her refusal to receive the narrator's wife"": This part is also grounded in event 7 of Chapter 22.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. Both pieces of information are presented together in the same event, indicating a simultaneous occurrence.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation or assumption; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline. There is no contradiction with the book summary, as the summary does not provide details about the Duchess's future actions or relationships beyond the main plot.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID."
