In a tale set in the medieval North, the story follows the life of Sintram, a young knight plagued by dark dreams and a mysterious curse. The narrative begins in the high castle of Drontheim, where a council of knights is interrupted by Sintram's terrifying visions. His father, Biorn of the Fiery Eyes, dismisses the incident, revealing that Sintram has been haunted by these episodes annually since childhood. The priest of the castle, along with Rolf the Good, Sintram's loyal retainer, are deeply concerned, sensing a connection to a past sin involving Biorn.

Sintram's life is marked by his struggle against these dark forces, which seem to be linked to a curse brought upon by Biorn's violent oath against two shipwrecked German merchants, Gotthard and Rudlieb, whom he had intended to kill but were saved by a divine intervention. Sintram's mother, Verena, now a nun, prays for her son, hoping for his redemption. Throughout the story, Sintram battles internal and external demons, including a mysterious figure known as the little Master, who tempts him with visions of power and love.

A turning point occurs when Folko of Montfaucon, a noble knight, and his wife Gabrielle arrive at the castle. Their presence brings a semblance of peace and light into Sintram's troubled soul. Folko, related to Sintram's family, becomes a mentor figure, encouraging Sintram to overcome his inner darkness and embrace his noble heritage. Gabrielle's beauty and kindness deeply affect Sintram, awakening a longing for purity and redemption.

The story reaches its climax when Sintram faces a final test of character during a battle against Jarl Eric the Aged, a conflict sparked by Biorn's past enmity. Sintram's bravery and newfound resolve, inspired by Folko and Gabrielle, lead him to victory. The battle also reveals the presence of the little Master, disguised as a warrior, whom Sintram defeats, symbolizing his triumph over the dark forces within him.

As the tale concludes, Sintram, now a changed man, seeks the blessing of his mother, Verena, and dedicates himself to a life of virtue and service. He becomes a protector of the weak and a beacon of hope, reflecting the light of redemption that Folko and Gabrielle brought into his life. The story ends with Sintram embracing his destiny, free from the curse that once haunted him, and looking forward to a future of honor and peace.
