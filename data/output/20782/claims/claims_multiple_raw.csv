"Roger's planetoid loses artificial gravity when Costigan and Bradley destroy its power room, later resists a Nevian attack before succumbing to a converting beam, and finally, a small section escapes destruction with Roger and select scientists aboard.","Roger's planetoid gains artificial gravity when Costigan and Bradley destroy its power room, later succumbs to a Nevian attack without resistance, and finally, the entire structure escapes destruction with Roger and all inhabitants aboard.","This fact outlines the progression of events related to Roger's planetoid. It begins with the loss of artificial gravity due to Costigan and Bradley's actions, continues with the planetoid's resistance and eventual defeat by the Nevian attack, and concludes with Roger's escape in a small section of the structure.","This corrupted fact contradicts the information in the chapter outlines by stating that the planetoid gains gravity instead of losing it, fails to resist the Nevian attack, and escapes destruction in its entirety rather than just a small section.","Chapters 2, 4, 11","- Chapter 2, item 3: The two men destroy the power room of the planetoid, causing it to lose artificial gravity.
- Chapter 4, item 6: Roger's planetoid resists the Nevian attack but ultimately succumbs to the converting beam.
- Chapter 11, item 1: Roger and his select group of scientists escape the destruction of their planetoid in a small section of the structure.

"The spaceship Boise progresses from being reconstructed at the Hill facility to testing its inertialess drive, causing severe physical discomfort to Rodebush and Cleveland, and finally employing an inertialess tractor beam to rescue Costigan, Bradley, and Clio from their speedster.","The spaceship Boise progresses from being constructed at the Hill facility to testing its conventional drive, causing no physical discomfort to Rodebush and Cleveland, and finally employing a standard tractor beam to rescue Costigan, Bradley, and Clio from their speedster.","This fact demonstrates the development and increasing capabilities of the Boise. It starts with its reconstruction, moves to the testing of its revolutionary inertialess drive, and culminates in the practical application of its advanced technology in a rescue mission.","This corrupted fact contradicts the information in the chapter outlines by stating that the Boise is being constructed rather than reconstructed, has a conventional drive instead of an inertialess one, causes no physical discomfort during testing, and uses a standard tractor beam rather than an inertialess one.","Chapters 7, 10, 13","- Chapter 7, item 7: Cleveland and Rodebush inspect the reconstruction of the spaceship Boise in a vast room within the Hill.
- Chapter 10, item 1: Rodebush and Cleveland test the Boise's inertialess drive, experiencing severe physical discomfort during the initial activation.
- Chapter 13, item 2: The Boise rescues Costigan, Bradley, and Clio from their speedster using an inertialess tractor beam.

"The conflict between Earth and Nevia escalates from a Nevian vessel attacking Pittsburgh to extract iron, to the Boise confronting the Nevian vessel over Earth, and finally to the Boise destroying a Nevian city using Adlington's ""Special"" bomb.","The conflict between Earth and Nevia de-escalates from the Boise destroying a Nevian city using Adlington's ""Special"" bomb, to the Boise confronting a Nevian vessel over Earth, and finally to a Nevian vessel peacefully visiting Pittsburgh to trade for iron.","This fact outlines the progression of the conflict between Earth and Nevia. It begins with the Nevian attack on Pittsburgh, continues with Earth's retaliation using the advanced Boise spaceship, and culminates in the destruction of a Nevian city, showing the increasing intensity and scale of the conflict.","This corrupted fact reverses the order of events and misrepresents the nature of the Nevian visit to Pittsburgh, contradicting the information provided in the chapter outlines.","Chapters 8, 10, 13","- Chapter 8, item 4: A Nevian vessel attacks Pittsburgh, using a beam to extract iron and cause destruction.
- Chapter 10, item 3: After testing the ship's capabilities, they return to Earth in minutes to confront a Nevian vessel attacking Pittsburgh.
- Chapter 13, item 5: Upon reaching Nevia, the Boise destroys a Nevian city using Adlington's ""Special"" bomb.
