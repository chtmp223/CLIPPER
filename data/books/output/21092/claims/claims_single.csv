2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The claim directly states an event that occurs when Coxine and his crew board the Polaris.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation or assumption; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.

   b. ""worth twenty million credits"": This part is grounded in the chapter outline, which states that the Titan pay roll is worth twenty million credits.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid because the claim incorrectly identifies the discovered item as a cache of advanced weapons instead of the Titan pay roll. The chapter outline does not mention advanced weapons, so the relationship between the discovery and the value is incorrect.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it misrepresents the nature of the discovery.
