    b. ""leads to immediate agreement over Gorla's career choice"": There is no mention of an agreement over Gorla's career choice during their initial reunion in Chapter 2. The discussion about Gorla's career choice occurs in Chapter 5, where Yeovil expresses surprise and disapproval, leading to a disagreement with Cicely.
    c. ""and Cicely's decision to host a supper party for Gorla's debut"": Cicely's decision to host a supper party for Gorla's debut is discussed in Chapter 5, not during their initial reunion in Chapter 2.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not valid because the claim suggests a causal link between the initial reunion and an agreement over Gorla's career choice and the supper party, which is not supported by the chapter outline.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the events related to Gorla's career and the supper party occur later and involve disagreement, not agreement.

Since 1b., 1c., 2a., and 2b. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
