In rural England, at the majestic Cholmondeley Castle, the Earl of Rossmore and his son, the Honourable Kirkcudbright Llanover Marjoribanks Sellers Viscount-Berkeley, discuss a long-standing claim by an American named Simon Lathers, who asserts he is the rightful Earl of Rossmore. The young Viscount, known as Berkeley, is determined to investigate the claim, believing in the American's right to the title. Despite his father's objections, Berkeley decides to travel to America to meet Simon Lathers and exchange places with him if the claim proves legitimate.

Meanwhile, in America, the young Viscount, now under the alias Howard Tracy, struggles to find work and a place in society. He becomes involved with various characters, including the Sellers family, who are dealing with their own issues of identity and legacy. The Sellers, particularly Colonel Mulberry Sellers, are depicted as dreamers and schemers, constantly pursuing grandiose projects and inventions.

Tracy's journey is complicated by his romantic interest in Sally Sellers, the Colonel's daughter, who is unaware of his true identity. Sally is depicted as a practical and hardworking young woman, dedicated to supporting her family through her talents in costume design. As Tracy navigates his feelings for Sally and his own identity crisis, he grapples with the expectations and realities of his noble heritage.

The narrative intertwines with the story of the American Claimant, Simon Lathers, who has been pursuing the earldom for years. The Earl of Rossmore, back in England, is determined to maintain his family's legacy and is skeptical of the American claim. However, the death of the Earl's son in a hotel fire in Washington complicates matters, as the Earl must now contend with the loss of his heir and the possibility of the title passing to an American.

Throughout the story, themes of identity, legacy, and the clash between old-world nobility and new-world democracy are explored. The characters are caught between their aspirations and the realities of their situations, leading to moments of humor, tragedy, and introspection.

In the end, the narrative suggests that true nobility and worth are not defined by titles or heritage but by one's actions and character. The story closes with a sense of resolution, as the characters come to terms with their identities and the paths they choose to follow.
