   a. Jefferson Hope used different methods to kill Drebber and Stangerson: This part is grounded in the chapter outline and the book summary. Hope forced Drebber to choose between two pills, one of which was poisoned, at the house on Brixton Road. He killed Stangerson at Halliday's Private Hotel the following morning by stabbing him after Stangerson attacked him.
   b. Forcing Drebber to choose between two pills at the house on Brixton Road: This part is explicitly mentioned in both the chapter outline (event 5) and the book summary.
   c. Killing Stangerson at Halliday's Private Hotel the following morning: This part is also explicitly mentioned in both the chapter outline (event 6) and the book summary.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The claim accurately describes the different methods used by Hope to kill Drebber and Stangerson, as detailed in the chapter outline and book summary.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. Jefferson Hope used the same method to kill both Drebber and Stangerson: This part is partially grounded in the chapter outline and book summary. Hope forced Drebber to choose between two pills, one poisoned and one harmless, as described in Chapter 13, event 5. However, for Stangerson, the method was different; Hope attempted to use the same method but ended up stabbing Stangerson in the heart when attacked, as described in Chapter 13, event 6.
   b. Forcing them to choose between two pills at different locations: This part is partially grounded. Drebber was indeed forced to choose between two pills at a house on Brixton Road, but Stangerson was not killed by choosing pills; he was stabbed at Halliday's Private Hotel.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the method used to kill Drebber and Stangerson was not the same. While Hope intended to use the same method, the outcome was different for Stangerson.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation but rather a misrepresentation of the events as described in the chapter outline and book summary.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the methods of killing were different.
