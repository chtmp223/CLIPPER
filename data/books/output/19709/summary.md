The narrative begins with the crew of the rocket cruiser _Polaris_, which includes Space Cadets Tom Corbett, Roger Manning, and Astro, under the command of Captain Steve Strong of the Solar Guard. The story unfolds with the _Polaris_ approaching Earth, preparing for a landing at the Space Academy after a routine training flight. The cadets are excited about a potential leave, but Captain Strong informs them of a possible new assignment, hinting at a significant mission. The _Polaris_ unit, known for their excellence, is a tight-knit group with Tom as the command cadet, Roger as the radar specialist, and Astro as the power-deck cadet, each bringing unique skills and personalities to the team.

The setting shifts to Space Academy, a prestigious institution located in North America, where young cadets from Earth and its colonies train to become part of the Solar Guard. The Academy is a hub of activity, with cadets and officers bustling about, and the _Polaris_ unit is well-regarded among their peers. The narrative introduces Commander Walters, the commandant of the Academy, who oversees operations and assignments.

The story takes a turn as the _Polaris_ is assigned to a mission under the command of Major "Blast-off" Connel, a tough and legendary officer known for his rigorous standards. The mission involves testing a new audio communications transmitter in deep space, with the destination being the planet Tara in the Alpha Centauri system. Tara is depicted as a lush, tropical world, similar to Earth in its early stages of development, with potential for human habitation.

As the _Polaris_ prepares for the mission, tensions rise among the cadets, particularly with Roger Manning, who is known for his brash demeanor. The narrative delves into the dynamics of the crew, highlighting the camaraderie and occasional conflicts that arise from their diverse backgrounds and personalities. Major Connel's strict leadership style adds pressure to the cadets, pushing them to excel and meet the high expectations set for the mission.

The journey to Tara is fraught with challenges, including the implementation of hyperdrive technology, which allows for faster-than-light travel by affecting all atoms within the ship simultaneously, preventing the crew from feeling the effects of acceleration. The cadets undergo rigorous training to master this new technology, along with their regular duties on the ship.

Amidst the preparations, a subplot emerges involving Bill Loring and Al Mason, two disgruntled spacemen whose space papers have been suspended due to unauthorized actions on a previous mission to Tara. Loring and Mason, seeking a way to exploit a copper-rich satellite near Tara, plot to stow away on a space freighter, the _Annie Jones_, with the intention of hijacking it for their own gain. Their plan is to escape to Tara and claim the copper for themselves, highlighting their desperation and willingness to resort to piracy.

As the _Polaris_ continues its mission, the narrative explores themes of loyalty, duty, and the pursuit of knowledge. The cadets face moral dilemmas and personal challenges, testing their resolve and commitment to the Solar Guard and each other. The story emphasizes the importance of teamwork and the sacrifices required to achieve great feats in the vast expanse of space.

In a dramatic turn of events, Roger Manning, feeling the weight of potential guilt and the pressure of an impending investigation related to the crash of the _Annie Jones_, decides to escape, fearing the consequences of his actions. His disappearance adds tension to the narrative, as his unit-mates grapple with feelings of betrayal and concern for their friend.

The narrative concludes with the _Polaris_ unit, now joined by Cadet Alfie Higgins, preparing to embark on their mission to Tara. Despite the challenges and uncertainties they face, the cadets remain determined to succeed, guided by Major Connel's leadership and the bonds they have forged through their shared experiences. The story leaves the reader with a sense of anticipation and the promise of new adventures in the uncharted realms of deep space.
