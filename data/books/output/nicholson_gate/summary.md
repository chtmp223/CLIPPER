Laurance Donovan, an Irishman and writer, is staying at his friend John Glenarm's house in Annandale to work on his book about Russian rivers. His peaceful summer is interrupted by a telegram from his friend Paul Stoddard, a clergyman, asking him to meet Miss Patricia Holbrook at the Annandale station and escort her to St. Agatha's School. Donovan reluctantly agrees, and soon finds himself embroiled in the complicated affairs of the Holbrook family.

Miss Patricia Holbrook, known affectionately as Miss Pat, is an elderly woman of grace and dignity. She is accompanied by her niece, Helen Holbrook, a strikingly beautiful young woman. Donovan learns that the Holbrooks are hiding from Miss Pat's brother, Henry Holbrook, who has been threatening them in pursuit of a financial settlement that Miss Pat is reluctant to make. Henry is a troubled man, known for his dishonorable conduct and driven by greed.

As Donovan becomes more involved with the Holbrooks, he discovers that Helen is secretly meeting with her father, Henry, and is entangled in his schemes. Despite her duplicity, Donovan finds himself drawn to Helen's charm and beauty, even as he struggles to protect Miss Pat from her brother's machinations.

Meanwhile, Reginald Gillespie, a wealthy and eccentric young man, is also pursuing Helen. Gillespie's antics provide comic relief, but his presence complicates the situation further. He is infatuated with Helen and offers her financial assistance, which she accepts to help her father.

Donovan's investigation leads him to a houseboat on Tippecanoe Creek, where he encounters Arthur Holbrook, Henry's brother, who has been living in hiding under the name Robert Hartridge. Arthur took the blame for a financial scandal to protect Henry, sacrificing his own reputation and freedom. Despite his brother's betrayal, Arthur remains loyal and refuses to reveal Henry's crimes to their sister, Miss Pat.

The tension escalates when Henry hires an Italian sailor to threaten the Holbrooks, leading to a dangerous encounter on the lake. Donovan's efforts to protect Miss Pat and Helen become more urgent as Henry's desperation grows.

Amidst these challenges, Donovan and Helen engage in a battle of wits and emotions. Helen, torn between loyalty to her father and affection for her aunt, is a complex character whose motives are not always clear. Donovan, despite his initial irritation with her duplicity, finds himself increasingly captivated by her.

The story reaches a climax when Miss Pat, tired of running, decides to confront her brother and resolve the family conflict. Donovan, with the help of Gillespie and Arthur, works to ensure her safety and bring Henry to justice.

In the end, the truth about the Holbrook family is revealed, and Donovan's loyalty to Miss Pat is rewarded. The narrative explores themes of honor, loyalty, and the complexities of family relationships, set against the backdrop of a peaceful lake disrupted by the Holbrooks' turmoil.
