Despite this, Nan is a good-hearted girl who loves adventure, climbing trees, and playing with boys, which often lands her in trouble.

Her life takes a turn when Miss Blake, a governess, arrives to provide guidance and education. Initially resistant, Nan gradually warms to Miss Blake, who proves to be kind and understanding.
