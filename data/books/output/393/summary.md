In the early chapters, we meet Mr. Button, an old sailor on the ship Northumberland, who is known for his clumsiness but has a rich imagination filled with tales of fairies and leprechauns. The ship is on a difficult journey from New Orleans to San Francisco, and during a calm south of the line, the crew is restless and Mr. Button entertains them with his stories.

The narrative shifts to a tragedy at sea when the Northumberland catches fire. The crew and passengers, including Mr. Lestrange and his children, Dick and Emmeline, are forced to abandon ship. In the chaos, the children and Mr. Button end up in a small dinghy, separated from the others.

The story follows the children and Mr. Button as they drift to a deserted island. Over the years, the children grow up in this isolated paradise, learning to fend for themselves with Mr. Button's guidance. They build a home, explore the island, and form a close bond with the natural world around them. The island is described with vivid imagery, emphasizing its beauty and the children's adaptation to their new life.

As they grow older, Dick and Emmeline develop a deeper relationship, eventually falling in love. Their innocence and connection to nature are highlighted, as they live without the constraints of civilization. They experience life in its purest form, with the island providing for their needs and fostering their love.

The narrative also follows Mr. Lestrange's desperate search for his lost children. Believing they may have been saved by a passing ship, he spends years searching the Pacific, driven by a vision of them adrift at sea. Despite numerous setbacks, he never gives up hope, fueled by a deep intuition that they are still alive.

The story reaches a turning point when a schooner, captained by Stannistreet, is chartered by Mr. Lestrange for another search. The schooner comes across a small boat adrift, containing a girl and a baby. The girl, Emmeline, is holding a branch of berries, a symbol of her connection to the island and her life there with Dick.

The novel explores themes of innocence, love, and the impact of civilization on natural life. It contrasts the purity and simplicity of life on the island with the chaos and complexity of the outside world. The children's journey from innocence to experience is depicted through their relationship and the challenges they face in their isolated paradise.

Ultimately, the story is a meditation on the beauty and brutality of nature, the resilience of the human spirit, and the enduring power of love. It leaves readers with a sense of wonder and contemplation about the balance between civilization and the natural world.
