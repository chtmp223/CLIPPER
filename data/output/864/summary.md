The narrative revolves around the complex and tumultuous relationships within the Durrisdeer family, focusing on the return of the Master of Ballantrae, James Durie, and the impact of his presence on his brother, Henry Durie, and the rest of the household. The story is primarily told from the perspective of Ephraim Mackellar, the steward of the Durrisdeer estate, who is deeply loyal to Henry and observes the unfolding events with a critical eye.

The Master of Ballantrae, presumed dead, returns to the family estate, causing significant tension and upheaval. His charm and manipulative nature quickly unsettle the household, particularly affecting Henry, who has always lived in his brother's shadow. The Masterâ€™s presence revives old rivalries and creates new conflicts, as he seeks to exploit the family's resources for his gain.

Henry is portrayed as a man of integrity and duty, deeply committed to his family and estate but constantly undermined by his brother's schemes. Despite his efforts to maintain peace and order, the Master's influence leads to a series of tragic events, including a duel between the brothers that results in the Master's apparent death.

However, the Master survives and continues to haunt the family, both literally and figuratively. His presence looms over the estate, affecting Henry's mental health and straining his relationships with his wife and child. The family is eventually forced to flee to America, leaving the Master behind but not free from his shadow.

Throughout the narrative, themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the destructive power of envy are explored. Mackellar's observations provide insight into the moral and emotional struggles faced by the characters, particularly Henry, who is torn between his sense of duty and the overwhelming burden of his brother's malice.

The story concludes with the family's departure, leaving the estate in Mackellar's care, and the Master left to his own devices. The narrative reflects on the enduring impact of the Master's actions on the Durrisdeer family and the tragic consequences of unchecked ambition and rivalry.
