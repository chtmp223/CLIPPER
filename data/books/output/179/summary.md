In a bustling city, a lady gazes out of a hotel window at a gloomy graveyard, feeling restless and discontented. Her brother, Felix Young, sits nearby, sketching and humming to himself. The lady, Baroness Eugenia MÃ¼nster, is not happy with the dreary Boston weather and expresses her desire to leave. Felix, more optimistic, suggests waiting for better days. The siblings have recently arrived from Europe, and Eugenia is disillusioned with their situation, feeling they have made a mistake in coming to America.

Eugenia, a woman in her early thirties, is described as having a tired complexion but charming eyes. She is of noble birth, having married a German prince in a morganatic marriage, which means it is not fully recognized by the prince's family. Her marriage is under strain, and she is contemplating signing a document to dissolve it. Felix, on the other hand, is a carefree artist who enjoys life and is delighted to be in America, finding the country amusing and full of life.

The siblings are staying in Boston to connect with their American relatives, the Wentworths. Mr. Wentworth, their uncle, is a serious and reserved man, with two daughters, Charlotte and Gertrude, and a son, Clifford. The Wentworth family is intrigued by their European cousins, but they are also cautious and perplexed by Eugenia's sophisticated manners and Felix's free-spirited nature.

Eugenia and Felix soon become part of the Wentworths' social circle. Felix is particularly taken with Gertrude, who is different from her family, being more curious and open-minded. Gertrude is fascinated by Felix's stories and his artistic lifestyle, which is unlike anything she has known. Felix encourages Gertrude to embrace life and enjoy it, contrasting with the more somber, duty-bound outlook of her family.

Eugenia, meanwhile, navigates her new social environment with charm and wit, though she is aware of the underlying tensions. She is courted by Robert Acton, a wealthy and intelligent man who is intrigued by her complexity and European allure. Acton is cautious but captivated by Eugenia, who seems to be playing a delicate game with her emotions and intentions.

As the story unfolds, Felix paints portraits of the family, becoming a central figure in their lives. He suggests that Clifford, who has been suspended from college for drinking, could benefit from Eugenia's influence, hoping she might inspire him to adopt a more refined lifestyle. Clifford, however, is more interested in Eugenia than in reforming his ways.

The narrative explores themes of cultural contrast, personal freedom, and the search for happiness. Eugenia's presence challenges the Wentworths' traditional values, and her interactions with them reveal the complexities of identity and belonging. Felix, with his lighthearted approach to life, brings a new perspective to Gertrude, encouraging her to question her constrained existence.

In the end, the siblings' visit serves as a catalyst for change within the Wentworth family. Gertrude begins to see the possibility of a different life, while Eugenia contemplates her future, balancing her desire for independence with the realities of her situation. The story captures the nuances of human relationships and the impact of cultural exchange, set against the backdrop of a New England summer.
