Carley Burch, a young woman from New York, is deeply in love with Glenn Kilbourne, a soldier who returned from World War I shell-shocked and physically debilitated. After a painful parting, Glenn moves to Arizona to recover his health, leaving Carley longing and perplexed by his distant, cryptic letters. Despite her affluent lifestyle and social engagements, Carley is haunted by memories of Glenn and the changes the war wrought in him.

In an impulsive decision, Carley decides to travel to Arizona to see Glenn, driven by a desire to understand his transformation and rekindle their relationship. She arrives in the stark, rugged landscape of Oak Creek Canyon, where she is confronted by the raw beauty and solitude of the West. The canyon's vastness and the simplicity of life there are both alien and alluring to Carley, challenging her preconceived notions of happiness and fulfillment.

Carley meets the Hutter family, who have been caring for Glenn. They reveal Glenn's struggle to regain his health and his new life as a farmer and hog raiser. Carley is initially shocked and dismayed by Glenn's choice of work, which seems a world away from their previous life in New York. However, as she spends time with him, she begins to see the nobility in his labor and the healing power of the land.

Despite the deepening of her love for Glenn, Carley is torn by her inability to imagine a life in the West. Her internal conflict intensifies as she witnesses the stark contrast between the superficiality of her former life and the profound simplicity of Glenn's new existence. Carley's struggle is further complicated by the presence of Flo Hutter, a capable and spirited young woman who has grown close to Glenn during his recovery.

Carley's visit culminates in a confrontation with her own limitations and the realization that she cannot commit to Glenn's life in the West. She returns to New York, heartbroken and burdened by the awareness of her selfishness and the loss of a love she could not sustain. Back in the city, Carley is engulfed by the emptiness of her social world and the superficial pursuits that once satisfied her.

Haunted by her decision, Carley receives a letter from Glenn, who expresses his enduring love and describes his life in the canyon with vivid detail. The letter rekindles her feelings and prompts her to visit Virgil Rust, a wounded soldier and Glenn's comrade, in a hospital. Through Rust, Carley gains a deeper understanding of the sacrifices made by soldiers and the profound impact of the war on their lives.

Carley's experiences lead her to a moment of self-reckoning, where she acknowledges her failure to rise to the challenge of Glenn's love and the life he offered. She resolves to find purpose beyond the confines of her previous existence, driven by the realization that true fulfillment comes from sacrifice and meaningful work. The story ends with Carley at a crossroads, poised to redefine her life and embrace the values she has come to understand.
