The story begins with the Sieur Louis de Conte, who was born in Neufchateau in 1410, two years before Joan of Arc was born in Domremy. His family, Armagnacs—French patriots—fled from Paris due to the Burgundian party, who supported the English. Louis's family suffered greatly, losing everything except his father's small nobility. In Neufchateau, Louis found a region of comparative quiet, unlike the chaos and violence of Paris. At five years old, he witnessed the disaster of Agincourt, which left France prostrate, and saw his family butchered by raiders. He was sent to Domremy to live with a priest, Guillaume Fronte, and his loving housekeeper, who became like a mother to him. 

In Domremy, Louis grew up with Joan and other village children, forming a close bond. The village was staunchly Armagnac, fiercely hating the English and Burgundians. Despite the political turmoil, their childhood was filled with simple joys and innocence.

As Joan grew, she became increasingly serious and thoughtful, burdened by the plight of France. At fourteen, she began to experience visions and hear voices which she believed were from God, instructing her to save France. Despite the skepticism and ridicule from her village, Joan was resolute in her mission. She eventually persuaded her uncle to take her to Vaucouleurs, where she sought an audience with the governor, Robert de Baudricourt, to gain support for her divine mission.

Joan's persistence and conviction eventually won over the governor, and she was sent to the King. Along the way, her presence and faith inspired those around her, including Louis and other childhood friends. Her journey was marked by miraculous events and divine guidance, as she gathered an army and led them to victories against the English, culminating in the lifting of the siege of Orleans.

Throughout her campaign, Joan remained humble and devoted to her mission, despite the growing fame and adulation. She was ennobled by the King but refused any personal gain, focusing solely on her divine task to crown the Dauphin and drive the English out of France.

Joan's story is one of unwavering faith, courage, and selflessness. Her leadership and victories inspired a nation, and her legacy as the Maid of Orleans continues to be celebrated. Her life, marked by both triumph and tragedy, remains a testament to the power of belief and the impact one person can have on the world.
