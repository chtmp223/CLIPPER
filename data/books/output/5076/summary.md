The narrative begins with Roy Glenister and his partner, Joe Dextry, returning to Nome, Alaska, after spending the winter in the States. They are eager to resume work on their gold mine, the Midas, which they believe will yield a fortune. They are joined on their journey by Helen Chester, a young woman who has stowed away on their ship to escape from the Ohio, a ship quarantined due to smallpox.

Upon their arrival in Nome, they find the town bustling with activity as people from all over have come seeking fortune in the gold-rich area. However, they soon discover that their mine has been jumped by a man named Alec McNamara, who has been appointed as a receiver by the court. This legal maneuver, orchestrated by McNamara and his associates, including Judge Arthur Stillman and lawyer Wilton Struve, poses a significant threat to Glenister and Dextry's claim on the Midas mine.

Helen Chester, who is Judge Stillman's niece, is unaware of the full extent of the conspiracy but becomes entangled in the events as she tries to fulfill her mission of delivering important documents. She encounters Glenister and Dextry, who help her despite their own troubles, and she begins to see the complexities of the situation unfolding in Nome.

As the story progresses, Glenister struggles with his instincts to fight back using the lawless methods of the frontier. He is torn between his love for Helen and his anger towards the corrupt legal system that seems to be against him. Meanwhile, Dextry, more experienced in the ways of the wild, is ready to take matters into his own hands, reflecting the tension between the old ways of the frontier and the new legal order being established.

The situation escalates when Glenister and Dextry, desperate for funds to fight their legal battle, consider reclaiming their gold by force. This leads to a dramatic confrontation at the mine, where they are nearly caught stealing back their gold from the sluices. Helen, who witnesses part of this, is left conflicted about her feelings for Glenister and the role she plays in the unfolding drama.

The narrative builds towards a climax as Glenister and Dextry, along with their allies, plan a daring move to reclaim what is rightfully theirs. They are up against McNamara's well-organized and ruthless operation, which has the backing of the corrupted elements of the law. The story highlights themes of justice, love, and the clash between the untamed spirit of the frontier and the encroaching influence of law and order.

The characters are driven by their motivations: Glenister's desire for justice and love, Dextry's adherence to the frontier's code, Helen's struggle between duty and her growing affection for Glenister, and McNamara's greed and manipulation. The setting of Nome, with its chaotic gold rush atmosphere, serves as a backdrop for the conflicts and alliances that form the heart of the story. Through a series of strategic moves, confrontations, and personal revelations, the characters navigate a world where the lines between right and wrong are blurred, leading to a resolution that tests their values and relationships.
