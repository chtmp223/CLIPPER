The narrative opens with a British officer, Desmond Okewood, in Rotterdam, seeking refuge from the rain in a German-run hotel recommended by a porter. Despite the hotel's full occupancy, Desmond manages to secure a room, thanks to the mention of a mutual acquaintance, Franz. As he settles in, he reflects on his mission to find his brother Francis, who has mysteriously disappeared, possibly on a secret mission in Germany. Desmond's thoughts are interrupted by a commotion outside his room, leading him to discover a dying man at his door.

The stranger, identified as Dr. Semlin, an American with a German connection, succumbs to a heart attack. Desmond, realizing the opportunity presented by Semlin's death, decides to assume his identity to infiltrate Germany and search for Francis. He finds a passport, a mysterious document, and a badge of the German secret police in Semlin's belongings. Desmond's plan is to leave the hotel undetected, but he is interrupted by Frau Schratt, the proprietress, who seems to be involved in shady dealings. She mistakes Desmond for a German agent and agrees to dispose of Semlin's body.

Desmond escapes the hotel through an air shaft and makes his way to the train station, where he encounters a helpful guide who warns him of a trap set by German agents. With the guide's assistance, Desmond boards the train to Berlin, narrowly avoiding capture by a man with a clubfoot, whom he suspects is a high-ranking German operative named Clubfoot.

On the train, Desmond meets Count von Boden, who believes Desmond to be a German agent on a mission. The Count escorts him to Potsdam, where Desmond is taken to a villa and meets General von Boden, the Count's father. Desmond is treated with respect but is informed that he will be taken to Berlin for an audience with an unknown figure.

In Berlin, Desmond is led to the Imperial Palace and finds himself face-to-face with the Kaiser. During the encounter, Desmond cleverly bluffs his way through, pretending to be on a mission for the German cause. The Kaiser, amused by Desmond's story, dismisses him, allowing Desmond to make his escape.

Desmond's journey continues as he seeks clues about Francis's whereabouts. He deciphers a cryptic message that leads him to a street in Berlin, where he hopes to find more information. However, his plans are interrupted when he encounters Lieutenant Schmalz, a German officer he had met earlier. Schmalz insists on accompanying Desmond to a hotel, where Desmond realizes he is being watched.

The narrative unfolds with Desmond's daring attempts to outwit his pursuers and uncover the truth about his brother's mission. Throughout his journey, Desmond navigates the treacherous landscape of wartime Germany, using his wits and the identity of Dr. Semlin to evade capture and continue his search for Francis. The story is a thrilling tale of espionage, deception, and the relentless pursuit of truth amid the chaos of war.
