Paul Grayson, an engineer for the Bureau of Astrogation, is preparing for a mission to Proxima Centauri I, a planet used as a space station despite its inhospitable conditions. As he leisurely makes his way to the spaceport, savoring his last moments of freedom before the confines of space travel, he encounters a woman named Nora Phillips. Their meeting is unexpected and intense, culminating in a kiss that is abruptly interrupted by an attack from behind. Paul is knocked unconscious, and when he regains consciousness, he finds himself being helped by Nora, who expresses concern for his wellbeing.

As Paul tries to make sense of the attack, he realizes his wallet, containing his identification, has been stolen. This theft becomes significant when he learns that someone has attempted to use his identity to board his spacecraft. The police become involved, and Paul is caught in a web of suspicion and intrigue. Despite the chaos, he is determined to proceed with his mission to Proxima I, where he hopes to test his theory about the Z-wave, a form of communication that could potentially link Earth and Neosol, the planet orbiting Neosol.

Chadwick Haedaecker, Paul's superior and the proponent of Haedaecker's Theory—which claims the Z-wave cannot propagate across interstellar space—expresses skepticism and warns Paul against pursuing his experiments. Haedaecker's opposition is rooted in his desire to maintain his reputation and authority in the scientific community.

Paul's journey to Proxima I is fraught with challenges, including another attempt on his life and the discovery of a dead body on the planet, a man who bears a striking resemblance to him. This discovery adds to the mystery, suggesting a deeper conspiracy against him. Despite these obstacles, Paul successfully conducts his experiments and receives a Z-wave transmission, which he records as evidence to support his theory.

Upon returning to Earth, Paul presents his findings to the Terran Physical Society, hoping to gain support for his theory. However, Haedaecker challenges the validity of Paul's evidence, claiming that Z-wave Central was offline during the time Paul claims to have received the transmission. The situation escalates, and Paul is accused of fraud. The tension in the auditorium mounts as the audience turns hostile, and Paul is arrested on charges related to the murder of John Stacey, a detective who had been helping him.

Throughout the narrative, Nora Phillips remains an enigmatic figure. Initially appearing as a potential ally, her sudden disappearance raises questions about her true intentions and involvement in the conspiracy against Paul. As Paul navigates the complexities of his situation, he is driven by a desire to uncover the truth, clear his name, and realize the dream of interstellar communication. The story unfolds in a universe where scientific ambition, personal motives, and political intrigue intersect, challenging Paul to prove his worth and integrity against formidable odds.
