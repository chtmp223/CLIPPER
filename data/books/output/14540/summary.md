In a world reshaped by the aftermath of a swift and decisive military defeat, the characters in this narrative navigate a society under foreign rule. Murrey Yeovil, recently returned from convalescence in Siberia, finds himself struggling to reconcile his identity as an Englishman with the new reality of a German-occupied London. His wife, Cicely, adapts to the changed circumstances by engaging in the social life of the city, attending events and hosting gatherings to maintain her status and connections. Her philosophy is to accept the fait accompli and make the best of the situation, while Murrey grapples with feelings of betrayal and loss.

Cicely's social circle includes a variety of characters, such as the young musician Ronnie Storre, who is charming and talented but ultimately self-absorbed. Joan Mardle, a sharp-tongued socialite, provides commentary on the shifting dynamics of their world, while Lady Shalem, a social climber, embraces the new regime to further her ambitions. The narrative also introduces Herr von Kwarl, a German statesman who discusses the challenges of assimilating the British population into the German Empire and the importance of capturing the younger generation's loyalty.

The story unfolds against the backdrop of events like Gorla Mustelford's debut as a dancer, which becomes a symbol of the new cultural landscape. Gorla's performance, attended by a mix of English and German spectators, highlights the tension between embracing the present and mourning the past. The narrative explores themes of identity, loyalty, and the personal choices individuals make in response to political upheaval.

As Murrey contemplates his future, he is torn between the allure of returning to a life of hunting and rural pleasures and the call to resist the occupation in some meaningful way. The story captures the complexity of living under occupation, where personal desires and national identity are in constant conflict, and where the choices of individuals reflect broader societal shifts. Through its characters, the narrative examines the varied responses to defeat and the struggle to find a path forward in a changed world.
