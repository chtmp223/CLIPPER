The story begins with the Rover brothers—Dick, Tom, and Sam—on a mountainside, realizing they have lost their way. They are concerned for their eldest brother, Dick, who has not responded to their calls. The Rovers are adventurous and honest lads living on a farm called Valley Brook in New York State, owned by their Uncle Randolph Rover. Their father, Anderson Rover, is often away on business. The boys have had many adventures, including a term at Putnam Hall, a journey to Africa, and a trip on the Great Lakes. They recently returned from a houseboat adventure on the Mississippi River.

After their return to the farm, Uncle Randolph receives a troubling letter about some traction company bonds he purchased. He goes to Carwell to investigate, leaving the boys at the farm. The brothers plan an outing to Chase Mountain, where they become separated from Dick. During their search, they stumble upon a mysterious cave filled with stolen freight. They overhear a conversation between three men—Merrick, Pike, and Dangler—planning to swindle their uncle. The boys attempt to capture Dangler but fail.

Back at the farm, they discover Uncle Randolph has been swindled out of his bonds by Merrick and Pike, who pretended to be from the traction company. The boys decide to track down the swindlers. They learn about a mysterious cave where stolen freight is stored and find evidence of a secret post-office used by the thieves. Despite their efforts, they fail to catch the men, who remain at large.

Returning to Putnam Hall, the boys are reunited with their friends and face new challenges, including dealing with a new bully, Tad Sobber. They have various adventures, including a feast interrupted by a live snake, which they suspect was planted by Sobber. The snake incident causes a stir, and Sobber is eventually implicated in the prank.

The boys learn that Tad Sobber is the nephew of Sid Merrick, the swindler. They embark on a sailing trip to investigate Merrick's hideout but encounter a storm. They find the Sobber homestead deserted but later spot Merrick and Sobber escaping in a boat. The chase leads to a confrontation, where Merrick and Sobber flee, leaving behind the stolen bonds. The brothers recover the bonds and return them to Uncle Randolph.

The story concludes with the Rover boys completing their final term at Putnam Hall, where they excel in their studies and participate in a successful commencement ceremony. They bid farewell to the school, reflecting on their adventures and looking forward to the future, which promises new challenges and opportunities.
