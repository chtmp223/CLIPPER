Once upon a time, in a modest workshop, an old carpenter named Master Antonio, known as Master Cherry for his cherry-red nose, found a peculiar piece of wood. As he prepared to carve it into a table leg, the wood mysteriously cried out, "Do not strike me so hard!" Astonished and frightened, Master Cherry decided to give the wood to his friend Geppetto, a lively old man with a yellow wig resembling a corn pudding, who intended to make a puppet that could dance and entertain.

Geppetto named his puppet Pinocchio, a name he believed would bring luck. As Geppetto crafted the puppet, Pinocchio began to exhibit mischievous behavior, even before he was fully assembled. Upon completion, Pinocchio ran away, causing chaos in the town. A soldier stopped him, but the crowd, misunderstanding the situation, led to Geppetto being taken to prison.

Left alone, Pinocchio returned home, where he encountered a Talking-Cricket. The Cricket warned him of the consequences of disobedience, but Pinocchio, annoyed, threw a hammer at it, accidentally killing it. Hungry and desperate, Pinocchio found an egg, only to have a chick hatch and fly away. His misadventures continued as he ventured into the village, seeking food, only to be drenched by a basin of water thrown by an annoyed resident. 

Returning home, Pinocchio fell asleep with his wooden feet on a brazier, which burned them to cinders. Geppetto, upon returning from prison, lovingly carved new feet for Pinocchio, despite his misbehavior. In gratitude, Pinocchio promised to attend school. Geppetto sold his coat to buy Pinocchio a spelling-book, highlighting his selfless love for his son.

On his way to school, Pinocchio was distracted by a puppet show. He sold his spelling-book to buy a ticket, only to be recognized by the puppets as their brother. The puppet master, Fire-Eater, initially intended to use Pinocchio as firewood but spared him after being moved by his pleas. In gratitude, Fire-Eater gave Pinocchio five gold pieces to take to Geppetto.

On his journey home, Pinocchio encountered the Fox and the Cat, who tricked him into burying his gold in the Field of Miracles, promising it would multiply. However, the duo robbed him, leaving Pinocchio penniless. When he sought justice, the judge, misunderstanding, imprisoned him. Upon release, Pinocchio continued his journey, only to be caught by a farmer and forced to work as a watchdog.

Eventually, Pinocchio escaped and returned to find the Fairy with Blue Hair, who cared for him like a mother. She promised he could become a real boy if he behaved well. Despite his intentions, Pinocchio was led astray by his friend Candlewick to the Land of Boobies, where boys played all day and never studied. There, Pinocchio and Candlewick turned into donkeys, a punishment for their laziness.

Sold to a circus, Pinocchio was forced to perform until he injured himself. Bought by a man intending to make a drum from his skin, Pinocchio was thrown into the sea but transformed back into a puppet when fish ate the donkey hide. He continued his adventures until he was swallowed by the Dog-Fish, a gigantic sea creature.

Inside the Dog-Fish, Pinocchio found Geppetto, who had been searching for him. Together, they escaped, aided by a friendly Tunny fish. Back on land, Pinocchio worked diligently to support Geppetto, who was ill. His good behavior and hard work eventually led to his transformation into a real boy, fulfilling the Fairy's promise. Reunited with Geppetto, Pinocchio learned the value of honesty, hard work, and love, finally bringing happiness to his father's humble home.
