Seymour Michael, a young officer stationed in India during the tumultuous times of the Mutiny, is a man driven by ambition and a desire for wealth and power. He is engaged to Anna Hethbridge, a woman he does not love, simply because of her fortune. However, upon discovering a wealthier prospect, he decides to abandon Anna. When a newspaper mistakenly reports him dead, Seymour chooses to let the error stand, using it as an opportunity to end his engagement without confrontation. His decision is fueled by a cold calculation rather than any sense of guilt or conscience.

Anna Hethbridge, left in shock by the news of Seymour’s supposed death, soon marries James Edward Agar, a wealthy squire, and moves to Stagholme, where she becomes stepmother to his young son, Jem. Her marriage is a hasty decision, possibly driven by a need for stability and comfort after Seymour's betrayal. However, Anna’s life at Stagholme is not entirely fulfilling, and she finds herself at odds with her stepson, Jem, whose straightforward honesty contrasts sharply with her own nature.

Years later, Jem Agar grows into a capable and respected officer in the Indian army. He is stationed on the frontier, tasked with holding a strategic position with a small force of Goorkhas. His leadership and bravery earn him admiration, but he is reported dead after a disastrous engagement. Unbeknownst to his family, Jem survives and is persuaded by his commanding officer, General Seymour Michael, to remain "dead" to the world for strategic reasons. Seymour, now a high-ranking officer, sees an opportunity to use Jem’s supposed death to further his own career.

Back in England, Anna Agar and her son Arthur, who is weak and effeminate, are unaware of Jem’s survival. Arthur, who harbors feelings for Dora Glynde, a family friend, is encouraged by his mother to pursue her, despite Dora's lack of interest. Meanwhile, Dora remains steadfast in her feelings for Jem, whom she believes to be dead.

As time passes, Jem’s mission is completed, and he returns to England, only to find that Seymour Michael has not informed his family of his survival, as promised. This betrayal leads to a confrontation where Jem demands explanations. The truth about Seymour’s manipulations and deceit is revealed, resulting in a dramatic showdown.

Arthur, driven by a deep-seated hatred for Seymour Michael—a hatred he seems to have been born with—confronts him violently, leading to Seymour’s death. This act, though committed in a fit of madness, is understood by those present as the culmination of a lifetime of deceit and betrayal on Seymour’s part.

In the aftermath, Jem is reunited with Dora, and they find solace and happiness in each other. Arthur, whose actions were driven by an uncontrollable impulse, is spared the consequences due to his mental state at the time. Anna Agar, who had been complicit in Seymour’s deceit by not revealing Jem’s survival, is left to reflect on the consequences of her actions and the hatred that consumed her life.

The story concludes with Jem and Dora looking towards a future together, having navigated the treacherous waters of deceit and ambition that had threatened to destroy them. The narrative weaves themes of love, betrayal, and the quest for power, set against the backdrop of colonial India and the societal expectations of Victorian England.
