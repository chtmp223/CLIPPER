    c. ""sets up a prank in Miss Mush's garden using Mr. Lambkin's costume"": This part is grounded in event 6 of Chapter 13, where William sets up a prank using Mr. Lambkin's costume in Miss Mush's garden.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful, as both actions (sneaking Mr. Blank into the house and setting up a prank in Miss Mush's garden) demonstrate William's mischievous behavior extending to his neighbors' properties.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly supported by the events in the chapter outline.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as William's mischievous nature is a recurring theme in the stories.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""William's mischievous behavior extends to his neighbors' properties"": This part is consistent with the book summary, which describes William's mischievous nature and his interactions with neighbors, leading to humorous situations.
   b. ""he sneaks Mr. Blank into his house through the front door"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. According to Chapter 3, William sneaks Mr. Blank into the library through a window, not the front door.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship between William's mischievous behavior and the specific actions described (sneaking Mr. Blank and setting up a prank) is meaningful, as both actions are examples of his mischievous behavior.
   b. However, the claim inaccurately describes the method by which Mr. Blank is brought into the house, which undermines the validity of the relationship.
   c. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation but is based on events in the chapter outline, though inaccurately described in part.

Since part 1b is not satisfied due to the incorrect detail about how Mr. Blank is sneaked into the house, the claim is INVALID."

    a. ""William captures both Evangeline Fish and Mr. Jones"": This part is partially grounded in the chapter outlines. William lures Evangeline Fish into his shed with cakes, which can be seen as a form of capturing her by making her late (Chapter 8, events 5 and 6).

    b. ""by luring them into enclosed spaces"": This part is only partially grounded. Evangeline is lured into William's shed, which is an enclosed space (Chapter 8, event 5). However, Mr. Jones is not lured into an enclosed space; he is captured on the beach and marched back to the boarding house (Chapter 11, events 5 and 6).
    c. ""using cakes for Evangeline and a pop-gun for Mr. Jones"": This part is grounded in the chapter outlines. William uses cakes to lure Evangeline (Chapter 8, event 5) and a pop-gun to capture Mr. Jones (Chapter 11, event 5).

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not entirely valid. While William uses different methods to deal with Evangeline and Mr. Jones, the claim inaccurately suggests that both were lured into enclosed spaces, which is not true for Mr. Jones.
