In a vibrant London setting, Lady Viola Holme is a captivating and beautiful woman, married to Lord Holme, a robust and somewhat boorish man. Their marriage is marked by Lady Holme's charm and Lord Holme's physicality, but beneath the surface lies complexity and tension. Lady Holme's allure draws many admirers, including Robin Pierce, a diplomat who believes he loves Viola for her hidden depths, not just her beauty, and Rupert Carey, a talented but self-destructive man who was once infatuated with her.

Viola's life is complicated by the arrival of Pimpernel Schley, an American actress who bears a striking resemblance to her. This resemblance, both physical and in mannerisms, is unsettling for Lady Holme and becomes a topic of gossip in London society. Miss Schley's slyness and ability to mimic Lady Holme's characteristics create an undercurrent of rivalry and tension.

Throughout the narrative, Viola grapples with her identity, her marriage, and her place in society. Her husband, Lord Holme, is oblivious to the subtleties of her inner life and is more concerned with his own pleasures and the physical aspects of their relationship. Viola, on the other hand, is drawn to the idea of being loved for more than her appearance, a notion championed by Robin Pierce, despite his inability to fully embody it.

The tension reaches a peak at a social event where Viola, in a moment of defiance, speaks publicly to Rupert Carey, who is visibly intoxicated. This act, seen by many, causes a scandal and angers Lord Holme, who reacts with jealousy and rage. Viola's impulsive action and Carey's subsequent humiliation highlight the fragility of her social standing and the volatility of her marriage.

Amidst these social intrigues, Sir Donald Ulford, an older gentleman with a deep appreciation for beauty and art, purchases a romantic and secluded house in Italy, Casa Felice. He invites Rupert Carey and later Lady Holme to visit, offering a potential escape from their tumultuous lives in London.

As the story unfolds, Viola's struggle with her identity and her desire for genuine love and acceptance become central themes. Her interactions with the men in her life—her husband, Robin Pierce, and Rupert Carey—reveal her longing for a deeper connection and understanding, which seems elusive in the superficial world she inhabits.

The novel explores themes of beauty, identity, and the complexities of human relationships, set against the backdrop of a society that values appearance and conformity. Lady Holme's journey is one of self-discovery and the search for authenticity in a world that often prioritizes the surface over the substance.
