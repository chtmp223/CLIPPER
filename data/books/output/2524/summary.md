The narrative begins with an elderly woman reflecting on the significant changes in society since her youth, particularly in communication and travel. She introduces Lady Ludlow, a dignified widow of noble lineage, who becomes a central figure in the story. The narrator's family, once connected to Lady Ludlow through a common ancestor, receives aid from her after the death of the narrator's father, a poor clergyman. Lady Ludlow invites the narrator's eldest daughter, Margaret Dawson, to live with her at Hanbury Court, providing her with education and companionship.

Upon Margaret's arrival at Hanbury Court, she observes the grandeur and old-world charm of the estate. Lady Ludlow, a woman of strong principles and traditions, maintains a household that reflects her aristocratic values. She is opposed to modern innovations and holds conservative views on education and social hierarchy. Her household includes several young gentlewomen, whom she treats with care and discipline, emphasizing their duties over their rights.

The story delves into the lives of other characters, such as Mr. Gray, the village clergyman, who is passionate about education and social reform. His views often clash with Lady Ludlow's, particularly regarding the education of the poor. Mr. Gray's efforts to establish a Sunday school are met with resistance from Lady Ludlow, who fears that education will lead to social upheaval.

Another significant character is Miss Galindo, a spirited and eccentric woman who becomes involved in the estate's affairs. She is characterized by her blunt speech and charitable actions, often taking in servants with physical infirmities. Despite her unconventional ways, she earns Lady Ludlow's respect and is eventually asked to assist with clerical work for the estate.

The narrative also explores the plight of Harry Gregson, a bright but impoverished boy whose education is secretly supported by Mr. Horner, the estate steward. Lady Ludlow, upon learning of Harry's education, is initially displeased but eventually comes to understand the value of Mr. Gray's efforts.

The story is interwoven with historical and social commentary, reflecting on the impact of the French Revolution and the changing times. Lady Ludlow's reflections on her past, including her friendship with the De Crequy family during her time in Paris, provide a backdrop to her conservative views.

As the story progresses, Lady Ludlow's character evolves, showing moments of compassion and understanding, particularly in her interactions with Mr. Gray and Miss Galindo. The narrative concludes with a sense of resolution, as Lady Ludlow reconciles her traditional beliefs with the changing world around her, acknowledging the necessity of education and reform while maintaining her dignity and grace.
