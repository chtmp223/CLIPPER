The narrative follows the extraordinary journey of Professor Lidenbrock, his nephew Axel, and their guide Hans as they embark on a daring expedition to the center of the Earth. The adventure begins in Hamburg, Germany, where Professor Lidenbrock discovers an ancient manuscript by the Icelandic alchemist Arne Saknussemm. The document reveals a path to the Earth's core through the crater of the extinct volcano Sneffels in Iceland.

Driven by scientific curiosity and ambition, the trio departs for Iceland, where they are guided by the stoic and resourceful Hans. They reach the summit of Sneffels and descend into the crater, navigating a network of tunnels and overcoming various geological challenges. The journey tests their endurance as they encounter subterranean landscapes, including vast caverns, ancient fossils, and even a subterranean sea.

Throughout the expedition, Axel struggles with fear and doubt, especially when separated from his companions and facing the possibility of being lost forever. However, the group's perseverance and Hans' steady guidance keep them moving forward. They encounter prehistoric creatures and navigate through dangerous volcanic activity, which threatens their lives.

As they delve deeper, they face near-starvation, intense heat, and the constant threat of volcanic eruptions. Despite these challenges, Professor Lidenbrock remains determined to reach the center of the Earth, driven by the legacy of Saknussemm and his own scientific zeal.

The climax of their journey occurs when they are caught in a volcanic eruption that propels them upward through a volcanic shaft. They are eventually expelled from the Earth's interior through the active volcano Stromboli in Italy, far from their original entry point in Iceland. This unexpected exit marks the end of their subterranean adventure.

Upon their return to the surface, the explorers are celebrated for their incredible journey, though many remain skeptical of their claims. Axel reflects on the adventure's impact on his life, including his newfound appreciation for his fianc√©e, Gretchen. Professor Lidenbrock, meanwhile, continues to revel in the glory of their discoveries, despite remaining puzzled by certain phenomena, such as the reversal of the compass needle, which Axel later attributes to magnetic interference during a storm.

The story concludes with the characters resuming their lives, forever changed by their journey to the center of the Earth, and with Professor Lidenbrock's reputation as a scientist solidified by their remarkable adventure.
