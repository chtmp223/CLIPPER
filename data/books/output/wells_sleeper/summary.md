In the first chapter, a young artist named Mr. Isbister encounters a man in distress on a path to Pentargen beach. The man, who has not slept for six nights due to overwork and trouble, is contemplating suicide. Isbister, feeling compelled to help, engages him in conversation and offers companionship, eventually persuading him to return to Boscastle with him. The stranger, who remains unnamed, is tormented by the demands of life and expresses a desire for rest, contemplating the possibility of finding peace in death.

As the narrative progresses, the man, known only as the Sleeper, becomes the center of a complex and futuristic world. He awakens from a cataleptic trance that lasted over two centuries, finding himself in a society that has evolved significantly since his time. The world is now dominated by immense cities, advanced technology, and new social structures. The Sleeper learns that he is the legal owner of the entire world, a position that grants him immense power and responsibility.

The society he awakens to is one of stark contrasts, with a privileged elite living in luxury while the masses toil in servitude. The Sleeper becomes a symbol of hope for the oppressed, who see him as a potential savior from their plight. However, he is also a pawn in the political machinations of those in power, particularly Ostrog, a cunning and ambitious leader who seeks to control the Sleeper for his own ends.

Throughout the story, the Sleeper grapples with his newfound role and the expectations placed upon him. He is torn between the desire to fulfill the hopes of the people and the realization of his limitations in understanding this new world. As he navigates the complexities of his position, he becomes increasingly aware of the unrest and discontent brewing among the populace.

The narrative is interspersed with scenes of futuristic technology and societal advancements, such as moving platforms, flying machines, and mechanized labor. These elements highlight the vast changes that have occurred during the Sleeper's long slumber and serve as a backdrop to the unfolding drama.

Ultimately, the Sleeper's journey is one of self-discovery and the struggle to assert his will in a world that is both familiar and alien. He faces the challenge of reconciling the ideals of his past with the realities of the present, all while navigating the treacherous waters of power and influence in a society that has evolved beyond his comprehension. The story explores themes of power, responsibility, and the enduring human spirit in the face of overwhelming change.
