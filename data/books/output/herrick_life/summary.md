The story begins in a Chicago hospital where Dr. Howard Sommers, a young surgeon, operates on Arthur C. Preston, a man who has been shot multiple times. Preston's wife, Alves, is present, and it is revealed that she has been living in difficult circumstances. Despite her challenging situation, she is determined to care for her husband, who is an alcoholic and has been living a reckless life.

As the narrative unfolds, we learn more about Alves's struggles. She is a schoolteacher in Chicago, trying to make ends meet while dealing with the emotional and financial burden of her husband's condition. Her life is further complicated by the societal expectations and the stigma attached to her situation. Dr. Sommers becomes involved in her life, initially out of professional obligation, but he gradually becomes more personally invested.

Dr. Sommers, who has his own internal conflicts about his career and the medical profession, finds himself drawn to Alves. He is disillusioned with the commercial aspect of medicine and struggles with the ethical implications of his work. Throughout the story, he grapples with his feelings for Alves and his professional responsibilities.

Alves, on the other hand, is depicted as a strong and resilient woman who is determined to do the right thing, despite the personal cost. Her dedication to her husband, even when it is clear that he will never recover fully, highlights her sense of duty and compassion. However, she also longs for happiness and fulfillment, which seem out of reach due to her circumstances.

The story also touches on the broader societal issues of the time, such as the struggles of the working class, the impact of industrialization, and the rigid social structures that constrain individuals. These themes are explored through the characters' interactions and the setting of Chicago, a city undergoing rapid change and development.

As the story progresses, Dr. Sommers and Alves develop a complex relationship. They are drawn to each other by a shared sense of isolation and a desire for something more meaningful in their lives. However, their relationship is fraught with challenges, including the ethical dilemmas posed by their professional and personal lives.

In the end, Alves makes a difficult decision to leave Dr. Sommers, believing that she is a burden to him and that he deserves a chance to pursue his career without the complications of her situation. Her departure is a selfless act, intended to free him from the constraints that her presence imposes.

The story concludes with Dr. Sommers reflecting on his life and the choices he has made. He is left to ponder the nature of success and fulfillment, and the role of love and duty in one's life. Through his experiences, he gains a deeper understanding of himself and the world around him, ultimately finding a sense of peace and acceptance.
