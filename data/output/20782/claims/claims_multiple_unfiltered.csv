   a. ""Costigan uses Vee-Two gas"": This part is grounded in Chapter 12, where Costigan produces and releases Vee-Two gas to escape his Nevian captors.
   b. ""the same type of gas used by the saboteur on the Hyperion"": This part is grounded in Chapter 1, where a saboteur releases Vee-Two gas into the Hyperion's air supply.
   c. ""to escape his Nevian captors"": This part is grounded in Chapter 12, where Costigan uses the gas to escape from the Nevians.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The claim connects the use of Vee-Two gas in two different contexts: first as a weapon by a saboteur on the Hyperion and later by Costigan to escape his captors.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline that Costigan uses the same type of gas.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as both instances of Vee-Two gas usage are clearly described.

Since all atomic parts are grounded in the chapter outline and the relationship between them is valid and meaningful, the claim is consistent with the provided information.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Costigan uses Vee-Three gas"": The claim mentions ""Vee-Three gas,"" but both the book summary and chapter outline refer to ""Vee-Two gas."" There is no mention of ""Vee-Three gas"" in either the summary or the outline, indicating a potential error in the claim.
   b. ""the same type of gas used by the saboteur on the Hyperion"": The chapter outline and book summary confirm that Vee-Two gas was used by the saboteur on the Hyperion.
   c. ""to escape his Nevian captors"": The chapter outline for Chapter 12 confirms that Costigan uses Vee-Two gas to escape his Nevian captors.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship between the use of gas by Costigan and the saboteur is meaningful if the gas type is the same. However, the claim incorrectly identifies the gas as ""Vee-Three"" instead of ""Vee-Two,"" which is inconsistent with the provided information.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation but is based on the events described in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship would make sense if the gas type were correctly identified as Vee-Two, as both instances involve using the gas for incapacitation.

Since the claim incorrectly identifies the gas type as ""Vee-Three"" instead of ""Vee-Two,"" it is not consistent with the book summary and chapter outline. Therefore, the claim is INVALID."
