In a tale of intrigue and adventure set in the Fire Weed country of Canada's West, Sergeant Jack Childress of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police embarks on a covert mission to uncover a band of horse rustlers operating across the Medicine Line, the mythical boundary separating Canada and the United States. Disguised as a rancher, Childress purchases a strategic section of land from the Maple Leaf Midland Railroad, intending to use it as a base to observe and capture the rustlers.

Childress's first encounter with the Fire Weed community occurs when he attempts to rescue Ethel Andress, a wealthy widow and member of the Strathconna Hunt Club, from a runaway horse. Although his intentions are misunderstood, his actions earn him an invitation to dine with Ethel and her uncle, Major Ivan MacDonald, a respected pioneer. However, Childress's covert mission requires discretion, and he declines the offer, further piquing the interest of Ethel and her suitor, Tom Fitzrapp, the manager of the Rafter A Ranch.

Fitzrapp harbors suspicions about Childress, particularly after witnessing his meeting with Bernice "Flame" Gallegher, a fiery young woman from a neighboring ranch. Flame, who initially competed with Childress for the same section of land, warns him of the danger posed by local ranchers who suspect him of being involved with the rustlers. Despite her warning, Childress remains steadfast in his mission, determined to uncover the truth and clear his name.

As Childress settles into his new role as a rancher, he encounters various challenges, including a confrontation with Duncan O'Hara, a former Rafter A buster who reveals that the rustlers plan to frame Childress by planting stolen horses on his land. With O'Hara's help, Childress foils the plot and begins to unravel the network of deceit surrounding the rustling operations.

Meanwhile, Ethel Andress grapples with her feelings for Fitzrapp, whose repeated failures to capture the rustlers cast doubt on his capabilities and intentions. Her suspicions grow when Fitzrapp loses a prized stallion, Canada, and reports seeing Childress involved in a raid. Ethel's internal conflict intensifies as she considers taking direct action against the rustlers by baiting them into a trap.

The narrative builds to a climax when Childress, now fully integrated into the outlaw community of Crow's Nest, confronts Smiling Dick Murdock, a member of the Gallegher outfit, who attempts to assault Flame Gallegher. In a daring escape, Childress and Flame ride out of the outlaw camp under a hail of gunfire, solidifying their bond and leading to their eventual marriage.

In a dramatic turn of events, Childress reveals his true identity as a Mountie and arrests Fitzrapp, who is exposed as the mastermind behind the rustling operations. With the help of O'Hara, who turns state's evidence, Childress dismantles the criminal network and restores peace to the Fire Weed country.

The resolution sees Childress resigning from the Mounted Police to settle down as a rancher with Flame, while Ethel Andress, freed from the shadow of Fitzrapp's deceit, contemplates her future in the vibrant and challenging landscape of the Canadian West. The story concludes with the promise of new beginnings and the enduring spirit of justice that defines the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
