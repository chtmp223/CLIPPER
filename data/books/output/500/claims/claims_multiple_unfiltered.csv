   a. ""The piece of wood that becomes Pinocchio exhibits signs of life even before being carved"": This part is grounded in Chapter 1, where the wood speaks and reacts to Mastro Cherry's actions, indicating signs of life.
   b. ""speaking to both Mastro Cherry and Geppetto"": The wood speaks to Mastro Cherry in Chapter 1, but there is no mention of it speaking to Geppetto in the chapter outline. However, the summary indicates that the wood's liveliness continues as Geppetto carves Pinocchio, suggesting an ongoing liveliness.
   c. ""continuing to show liveliness as Geppetto carves its features"": This part is grounded in Chapter 3, where Pinocchio's features come to life and misbehave as Geppetto carves them.

   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it contradicts the established timeline of events.
