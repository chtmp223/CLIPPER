   a. The arrival of new servants Clara and Ethelwyn, who replace Mrs. Viney for most household tasks: This part is grounded in event 1 of Chapter 14.
   b. Mother begins teaching lessons to the children at Three Chimneys: This part is grounded in event 2 of Chapter 14.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship suggests a causal link, implying that the arrival of the new servants allowed Mother to have more time to teach lessons. This is a reasonable inference, as the new servants taking over household tasks could free up Mother's time.
   b. The relationship is not explicitly stated in the chapter outline, but it is a logical interpretation based on the sequence of events.
   c. The relationship does not contradict any information in the book summary or chapter outline.

Since the relationship is a reasonable interpretation of the events and does not contradict the provided information, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""The arrival of new servants Clara and Ethelwyn, who replace Mrs. Viney for most household tasks"": This part is grounded in event 1 of Chapter 14.
   b. ""prevents Mother from teaching lessons to the children at Three Chimneys"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. In fact, event 2 of Chapter 14 states that Mother begins teaching lessons to the children, which contradicts this part of the claim.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid because the chapter outline explicitly states that Mother begins teaching lessons, which contradicts the claim that the arrival of new servants prevents her from doing so.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the outline indicates that Mother is indeed teaching lessons.

- Relationship: Contrast and surprise",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""The children resume their routine of waving to the 9.15 train and sending love to their father"": This part is grounded in event 3 of Chapter 14, where it is mentioned that the children resume waving to the 9.15 train.
   b. ""It is unexpectedly the 11.54 train from which their father actually steps off, reuniting with Bobbie"": This part is grounded in events 6 and 7 of Chapter 14, where Bobbie's father steps off the 11.54 train and reunites with her.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is meaningful and valid. The claim highlights the contrast between the children's routine of waving to the 9.15 train and the unexpected arrival of their father on the 11.54 train, which is a significant plot point in the chapter.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it aligns with the events described in Chapter 14 and does not contradict any information in the book summary.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""The children's routine of waving to the 9.15 train"": This part is grounded in the book summary, which mentions the children waving to the passengers on the trains, and in event 3 of Chapter 14, where the children resume waving to the 9.15 train.
    b. ""is rewarded when their father unexpectedly steps off this train, reuniting with Bobbie"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. Event 6 of Chapter 14 states that Bobbie's father steps off the 11.54 train, not the 9.15 train. Therefore, this part contradicts the chapter outline.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the claim incorrectly states that the father steps off the 9.15 train, whereas the chapter outline specifies the 11.54 train.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline due to the incorrect train time.
