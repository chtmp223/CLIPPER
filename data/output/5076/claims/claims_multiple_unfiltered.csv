   a. ""The legal battle over the Midas mine begins with McNamara and Struve challenging Glenister's claim"": This part is grounded in Chapter 6, where McNamara and Struve arrive at the mine to inform Glenister of a legal challenge to their claim.
   b. ""continues with Wheaton's successful attempt to reclaim the mine using legal documents"": This part is not fully grounded. In Chapter 11, Wheaton presents legal documents to McNamara, but McNamara refuses to comply, and Judge Stillman does not acknowledge the documents' authenticity. Therefore, Wheaton's attempt is not successful.
   c. ""ends when Roy presents incriminating evidence against McNamara and Judge Stillman"": In Chapter 22, Roy tears up the incriminating documents Helen offers him, which effectively frees Judge Stillman and McNamara from serious legal consequences. This does not align with the claim that the legal battle ends with Roy presenting incriminating evidence.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the sequence of events described in the claim does not accurately reflect the progression of the legal battle as outlined in the chapters.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the claim misrepresents the outcomes of the legal battle.

Since parts 1b., 1c., 2a., and 2b. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
