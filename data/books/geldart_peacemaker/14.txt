THE LAST.


"Hush, dears! hush!" said a gentle voice, pointing to a shaded window. "He is asleep now, and we must have the window open for air this sultry evening. I would not rake that bed to-night, John, I think."

"It is _his_ garden, Emilie."

"Yes, I know"--and she sighed.--

"It _is_ his garden, and his eye always sees the least weed and the least untidiness. He will be sure to notice it when he is drawn out to-morrow."

"John there may be no to-morrow for Joe, he is altered very much to-day, and it is evident to me he is sinking fast. He won't come down again, I think."

"May I go and sit by him, Emilie?" said the boy, quietly gathering up his tools and preparing to leave his employment.

"Yes, but be very still."

It was a striking contrast; that fine, florid, healthy boy, whose frame was gaining vigour and manliness daily, whose blight eye had scarcely ever been dimmed by illness or pain, and that pale, deformed, weary sleeper. So Emilie thought as she took her seat by the open window and watched them both. The roses and the carnations that John had brought to his friend were quietly laid on the table as he caught the first glimpse of the dying boy. There was that in the action which convinced Emilie that John was aware of his friend's state and they quietly sat down to watch him. The stars came out one by one, the dew was falling, the birds were all hurrying home, children were asleep in their happy beds; many glad voices mingled by open casements and social supper tables, some few lingered out of doors to enjoy the beauties of that quiet August night, the last on earth of one, at least, of God's creatures. They watched on.

"I have been asleep, Emilie, a beautiful sleep, I was dreaming of my mother; I awoke, and it was you. John, _you_ there too! Good, patient, watchful John. Leave me a moment, quite alone with John, will you, Emilie? Moments are a great deal to me now."

The friends were left alone, their talk was of death and eternity, on the solemn realities of which one of them was about to enter, and carefully as John had shielded Joe, tenderly as he had watched over him hitherto, he must now leave him to pass the stream alone--yet not alone.

Emilie soon returned; it was to see him die. It was not much that he could say, and much was not needed. The agony of breathing those last breaths was very great. He had lived long near to God, and in the dark valley his Saviour was still near to him. He was at peace--at peace in the dying conflict; it was only death now with whom he had to contend. Being justified by faith, he had peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ. His last words were whispered in the ear of that good elder sister, our true-hearted, loving Emilie. "Bless you, dear Emilie, God _will_ bless you, for 'Blessed are the peacemakers.'"

An Historical Sketch of Ancient Assyria and Persia, with an Account of the recent Researches in those Countries,

NOTICES OF THE PRESS, ETC.

ANTHEAEUM.--"Mr. Vaux's work is well executed, and he gives an accurate and interesting summary of the recent discoveries made on the banks of the Tigris."

WEEKLY CHRONICLE.--"Fresh from the perusal of its immense array of facts, couched in pure phrase, and arranged in the most lucid order, we might be accused of enthusiasm, if we say it is the ablest summary of history and modern investigation with which we are acquainted; but, as most of our readers who open its pages will admit, our praise is far from being exaggerated."

SPECTATOR.--"One of the best historical, archaeological, and geographical compilations that has appeared."

WEEKLY NEWS.--"We can safely recommend it to the perusal of our readers as the most useful work which has yet appeared upon the subject it embraces."

STANDARD--"Mr. VAUX has done his part admirably. A book which we could wish to see in every 'Parlour Window.'"

BELL'S MESSENGER.--"We never met with any book which is more likely to elucidate the historical incidents of these localities."

ECONOMIST.--"A good and popular account of the recent discoveries, as well as the researches in the earliest known abode of mankind, and of the explanations they supply of many doubtful and disputed points of ancient history."

MORNING ADVERTISER.--"Mr. VAUX has rendered good service to the reading public."

GLOBE.--"The volume is profusely embellished with engravings of the antiquities of which it treats. We would recommend its perusal to all who desire to know whatever our countrymen have done and are doing in the East."

OBSERVER.--"A valuable addition to archaeological science and learning."

GUARDIAN.--"Nothing can be better than the spirit mid temper in which Mr. VAUX has written, and he appears to have completely accomplished his object in the composition of the book, which will assuredly take rank among the best and ablest compilations of the day."

NONCONFORMIST.--"A work more instructive and entertaining could scarcely have been produced for the objects specifically intended."

STANDARD OF FREEDOM.--"It will amply repay an attentive perusal, and we have no doubt that it will be very generally welcomed."

A purer body of ethics we have never read; and he who can peruse it without emotion, clothed as it is in the graceful garb of poetry, must have a very cold and insensible heart."--_Times_.

DEALINGS WITH THE INQUISITION AT ROME.

BY DR. GIACINTO ACHILLI.

Extract from the Work.--"It is to unmask and expose Popery, as it is at the present day, that I undertake the writing of this work ...I should be sorry for it to be said or thought, that I undertook it to gratify any bad feeling; my sole motive has been to make the truth evident, that all may apprehend it. It was for hearing and speaking the truth that I incurred the hatred of the Papal Court; it was for the truth's sake that I hesitated at no sacrifice it required of me; and it is for the truth that I lay the present Narrative before the public."

"What a treasure in a country house must not such an Encyclopaedia of amusing knowledge afford, when the series has grown to a few volumes. Not only an Encyclopaedia of amusing and useful knowledge, but that which will give to memory a chronological chart of our acquisition of information. This admirable idea is well followed out in the little volume in our hands. The notiore are all clear, full, and satisfactory, and the engravings with which the volume is embellished are every way worthy of the literary part of the work."--_Standard_.

"The work is well done, and deserves notice as a striking memorial of the chief occurrences of 1850."--_Atlas_.

"Books such as this are, and will be, the landmarks of social, scientific, mechanical, and moral progress; it extends to nearly four hundred pages of well-condensed matter, illustrated with numerous excellently engraved wood blocks."--_Advertiser_.

"It is a stirring and instructive volume for intelligent young people."--_Evangelical_.

The former Volume, for 1849, still continues on Sale.

NOTICES OF THE PRESS "Descriptions of such Shrines come home with deep interest to all hearts--all English hearts--particularly when they are done with the earnestness which distinguishes Mrs. Hall's writings. That lady's earnestness and enthusiasm are of the right sort--felt for freedom of thought and action, for taste, and for genius winging its flight in a noble direction. They are displayed, oftentimes most naturally, throughout the attractive pages of this volume."--_Observer._

"Mrs. Hall's talents are too well known to require our commendation of her 'Pilgrimages,' which are every way worthy of the beautiful woodcuts that illustrate almost every page, and this is very high praise indeed."--_Standard._

"The illustrations are very effective; and the whole work externally and internally, is worthy of the patronage of all who love to be instructed as well as amazed."_--Church and State Gazette._

"The book is a pleasant one; a collection of a great deal of curious information about a number of curious places and persons, cleverly and readily put together, and combined into an elegant volume."--_Guardian_.
