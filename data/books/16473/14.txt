THE LAST WORD.


The lovely autumn is gone, and winter is here. Mr. and Mrs. Graham have long since been settled at home, and Hildegarde is with them. How does it fare with her, the new Hildegarde, under the old influences and amid the old surroundings? For answer, let us take the word of her oldest friend,--the friend who "_knows_ Hildegarde!" Madge Everton has just finished a long letter to Helen McIvor, who is spending the winter in Washington, and there can be no harm in our taking a peep into it.

     "You ask me about Hilda Graham; but, _alas!_ I have      NOTHING pleasant to tell. My dear, Hilda is simply      LOST to us! It is all the result of that _dreadful_      summer spent among _swineherds_. You know what the Bible      says! I don't know exactly _what_, but something _terrible_      about that sort of thing. Of course it is _partly_ her      mother's influence as well. I have always DREADED      it for Hilda, who is so _sensitive_ to _impressions_. Why, I      remember, as far back as the first year that we were at Mme.      Haut-Ton's, Mrs. Graham saying to Mamma, 'I wish we could      interest our girls a little in _sensible_ things!' My dear,      she meant _hospitals_ and _soup-kitchens_ and things! And      Mamma said (you know Mamma isn't in the _least_ afraid of      Mrs. Graham, though I confess I AM!), 'My _dear_      Mrs. Graham, if there is _one_ thing Society will      NOT tolerate, it is a _sensible_ woman. Our girls      might as well have the small-pox at once, and be done with      it.' Wasn't it _clever_ of Mamma? And Mrs. Graham just      LOOKED at her as if she were a _camel_ from      _Barnum's_.

     "Well, poor Hildegarde is sensible enough _now_ to satisfy      _even_ her mother. Ever since she came home from that      _odious_ place, it has been one round of hospitals and      tenement-houses and _sloughs of horror_. I don't mean that      she has given up school, for she is studying harder than      ever; but out of school she is simply _swallowed up_ by      these wretched things. I have remonstrated with her _almost_      on my KNEES. 'Hildegarde,' I said one day, 'do you      REALIZE that you are practically _giving up_ your      _whole_ LIFE? If you once _lose your place_ in      Society among those of your _own age_ and _position_, you      NEVER can regain it. Do you REALIZE this, Hilda?      for I feel it a SOLEMN DUTY to _warn_ you!' My      dear, she actually LAUGHED! and only said, 'Dear      Madge, I have only just begun to have any life!' And that      was _all_ I could get out of her, for just then some one      came in. But even _this_ is not _the worst_! Oh, Helen! she      has some of the _creatures_ whom she saw this summer,      actually _staying_ in the house,--in THAT house,      which we used to call Castle Graham, and were almost afraid      to enter ourselves, so stately and beautiful it was! There      are two of these creatures,--a girl about our age, some sort      of dreadful cripple, who goes about in a bath-chair, and a      freckled imp of a boy. The girl is at ---- Hospital for      treatment, but spends _every Sunday_ at the Grahams', and      Hilda devotes _most_ of her spare time to her. The boy is at      school,--one of the _best_ schools in the city. 'But _who_      are these people?' I hear you cry. My dear! they are simply      _ignorant paupers_, who were Hilda's constant companions      through that _disastrous summer_. Now their mother is dead,      and the people with whom Hilda stayed have adopted them. The      boy is to be a doctor, and the girl is going to get well,      Dr. George says. (_He_ calls her a beautiful and interesting      creature; but you know what _that_ means. _Any diseased_      creature is beautiful to _him_!) Well, and THESE,      my dear Helen, are Hilda Graham's FRIENDS, for whom      she has _deserted_ her OLD _ones_! for though she      is _unchanged_ towards me when I see her, I hardly ever      _do_ see her. She cares nothing for _my_ pursuits, and I      certainly have NO intention of joining in _hers_. I      met her the other day on _Fifth Avenue_, walking beside that      _odious_ bath-chair, which the freckled boy was pushing. She      looked so _lovely_ (for she is prettier than ever, with a      fine color and eyes like _stars_), and was talking so      earnestly, and walking somehow as if she were treading on      air, it sent a PANG through my heart. I just paused      an instant (for though I _trust_ I am not SNOBBISH,      Helen, still, I _draw the line_ at bath-chairs, and will      _not_ be seen standing by one), and said in a low tone,      meant _only_ for _her ear_, 'Ah! has _Queen Hildegarde_ come      to _this_?' My dear, she only LAUGHED! But that      _girl_, that cripple, looked up with a smile and a sort of      flash over her face, and said, just as if she _knew_ me,      'Yes, Miss Everton! the Queen has come to her kingdom!'"
