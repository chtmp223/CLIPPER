The story unfolds with Rose Campbell, a young girl who has recently lost her father and is now living with her great-aunts. The setting is a large, old mansion filled with history, odd nooks, and mysterious passages. Rose, feeling lonely and out of place, struggles to find comfort in her new home. Her aunts, Aunt Plenty and Aunt Peace, try to cheer her up with various activities and gifts, but Rose remains despondent until she discovers a new friend in Phebe Moore, a spirited girl who works in the kitchen.

As the story progresses, Rose's guardian, Uncle Alec, arrives. He is a kind and understanding man who takes a keen interest in Rose's well-being. He immediately sets about changing Rose's lifestyle, encouraging her to engage in healthy activities, such as outdoor exercises and a balanced diet, which he believes are essential for her growth and happiness. Uncle Alec's unconventional methods, such as prescribing laughter and play instead of traditional medicine, begin to transform Rose, making her healthier and more vibrant.

Rose's life becomes more exciting as she gets to know her seven boy cousins—Archie, Charlie, Mac, Steve, Will, Geordie, and Jamie—each with their distinct personalities. The boys, though initially a source of intimidation for Rose, become her companions and playmates, helping her to integrate into the family and enjoy her childhood.

Throughout the story, Rose learns valuable lessons about friendship, responsibility, and the importance of family. She develops a special bond with Phebe, who becomes her confidante and helps her navigate the complexities of her new life. Together, they share secrets and dreams, and Rose decides to help Phebe pursue her education, recognizing her intelligence and determination.

Uncle Alec's influence is profound, as he not only nurtures Rose's physical health but also her moral and emotional growth. He teaches her the importance of self-sacrifice, kindness, and understanding, which Rose embraces wholeheartedly. Her journey is marked by a series of small but significant sacrifices that help her grow into a compassionate and thoughtful young woman.

The story is rich with themes of self-discovery, the power of love and kindness, and the joys of childhood. Rose's transformation from a lonely, sad girl to a lively, healthy, and happy young lady is a testament to the positive impact of a loving and supportive environment. Her adventures with her cousins, her growing friendship with Phebe, and her bond with Uncle Alec make for a heartwarming tale of family and personal growth.
