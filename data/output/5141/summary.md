After the events of "What Katy Did," Katy Carr and her siblings embark on a new chapter in their lives. The story begins with a sweltering autumn in Burnet, where Katy, now recovering from her long illness, is regaining her strength and mobility. The Carr family is visited by Cousin Helen, and the children do their best to make her comfortable despite the oppressive heat. Meanwhile, Elsie and Johnnie are invited to visit Mrs. Worrett at Conic Section, a nearby farm. Despite Katy's reservations about the farm's proximity and potential lack of amenities, the children insist on going, eager for a change of scenery.

The visit to Conic Section proves to be a disappointment. The farm is not as idyllic as the children had imagined, and they face several discomforts, including a feather bed and the relentless heat. Elsie becomes homesick and miserable, longing to return to the comfort of her family. When Alexander, the Carrs' driver, arrives to take them home, the children are overjoyed. The experience at Conic Section becomes a humorous anecdote within the family, often referenced to temper Elsie's enthusiasm for future adventures.

Back in Burnet, Dr. Carr announces a new plan that will significantly impact the family: Katy and Clover are to attend a boarding school at Hillsover, known as "The Nunnery." Despite their initial reluctance and the prospect of being away from home, the sisters prepare for their journey. The school promises a new environment and experiences, and Dr. Carr hopes it will help Katy break free from the domestic responsibilities that have made her mature beyond her years.

Upon arriving at Hillsover, Katy and Clover find themselves in a rigorous academic setting with strict rules. They quickly make friends, including the lively and mischievous Rose Red, who becomes particularly close to Clover. The sisters navigate the challenges of boarding school life, which include dealing with the stern Miss Jane and the structured daily routine. Despite the initial culture shock, they adapt and even start a secret society, the S. S. U. C. (Society for the Suppression of Unladylike Conduct), to add some fun and camaraderie to their days.

However, trouble arises when Katy is accused of writing an inappropriate note to a college student, a charge she vehemently denies. The incident results in Katy and Clover being moved to a less desirable room, and Katy struggles with feelings of injustice and anger. Despite the setback, Katy resolves to "live it down" and prove her innocence through her conduct. Her determination and resilience earn her the respect of her peers and eventually soften the hearts of the school's authorities.

As the school year progresses, the girls experience the highs and lows of boarding school life. They participate in various activities, including wreath-making for the college's commencement and enjoying the summer beauty of Hillsover. The term ends with the announcement of Mrs. Florence's departure, adding a sense of change and uncertainty to the school.

During the autumn vacation, Katy and Clover visit their cousin, Mrs. Page, and her family, including the spoiled Lilly and the mischievous Clarence. The visit is not entirely pleasant, as they encounter snobbery and a lack of warmth. However, they also reconnect with Louisa Agnew, a school friend, and enjoy a delightful day with her family, which provides a refreshing contrast to their time at the Pages'.

Returning to Hillsover for another term, Katy and Clover are more settled and confident. They have grown through their experiences, learning to navigate friendships, handle challenges, and maintain their integrity. The story concludes with Katy, now a young woman, ready to embrace the future with the lessons and strength she has gained from her time at school.
