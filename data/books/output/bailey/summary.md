On Farmer Green's farm, a new arrival named Mistah Mule causes quite a stir among the animal residents. The old horse, Ebenezer, is particularly perturbed by Mistah Mule's presence, especially after Mistah Mule attempts to kick him. Mistah Mule, brought to the farm by Farmer Green, quickly gains notoriety for his mischievous behavior, including kicking Farmer Green himself, which sends the farmyard animals into a frenzy of gossip.

Mistah Mule's antics continue when Johnnie Green, Farmer Green's son, takes him for a ride. Initially, Mistah Mule proves to be a gentle and capable mount, but when Johnnie asks him to slow down, Mistah Mule abruptly stops, causing Johnnie to tumble off. Despite this, Mistah Mule insists he was only following Johnnie's command to "whoa."

Meanwhile, old Mr. Crow, a resident troublemaker, attempts to stir up discord by suggesting to the Muley Cow that she and Mistah Mule are related due to their similar tails. The Muley Cow is incensed by the suggestion and refuses to acknowledge any kinship with Mistah Mule. Mr. Crow, enjoying the chaos he creates, tries to involve Mistah Mule in teasing the Muley Cow, but Mistah Mule, recognizing Mr. Crow's intent, decides to have some fun of his own by playing along with the joke.

Mistah Mule's reputation as a troublemaker is further solidified when he and Ebenezer are harnessed together by Farmer Green. Mistah Mule, who has a penchant for shirking work, balks at the idea of pulling a wagon. When Farmer Green attempts to drive them, Mistah Mule employs a trick to avoid work, but Farmer Green outsmarts him with a piece of string tied to his ear, which distracts Mistah Mule enough to get him moving.

Despite his antics, Mistah Mule gradually starts to improve his behavior, especially as he and Johnnie Green develop a bond. Johnnie learns that Mistah Mule, although stubborn, does not bite, and begins to bring him apples, which Mistah Mule happily accepts. Encouraged by Mistah Mule's seemingly improved demeanor, Johnnie persuades his father to let him ride Mistah Mule, but only in the meadow to ensure his safety. Mistah Mule behaves well during these rides, much to the relief of Ebenezer, who begins to think that perhaps Mistah Mule is not so bad after all.

Throughout his time on the farm, Mistah Mule interacts with various other animals, including Turkey Proudfoot, who becomes enraged when Mistah Mule laughs at him. Mistah Mule's interactions with the farm's residents are often marked by his mischievous nature and his love for jokes, but as time passes, he begins to adapt to life on the farm, showing signs of becoming a more reliable member of Farmer Green's animal community.
