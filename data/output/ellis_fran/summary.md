In a small town called Littleburg, a girl named Fran arrives in search of Hamilton Gregory, a man she believes is connected to her past. The town is buzzing with a religious camp meeting, and Fran, a stranger to the community, causes a stir when she laughs during the service. This draws the attention of Abbott Ashton, the young superintendent of the local school, who is tasked with escorting her away from the meeting. Despite initial tension, Fran and Abbott form a tentative friendship.

Fran is revealed to be a complex character; she is both worldly and childlike, having traveled from New York with a mysterious connection to Gregory. She claims to be the daughter of a friend from Gregory's past, a claim that unsettles him due to its potential to unearth hidden secrets from his youth. Despite his initial reluctance, Gregory allows Fran to stay, presenting her as the daughter of an old friend.

Fran's presence in the Gregory household disrupts the existing dynamics. Gregory's wife, a gentle and passive woman, welcomes Fran, while Grace Noir, Gregory's beautiful and devout secretary, views Fran with suspicion and disdain. Grace, who harbors her own feelings for Gregory, becomes determined to uncover Fran's true identity and drive her away, seeing her as a threat to the household's stability.

As Fran settles into her new home, she becomes aware of the tensions between Gregory and his wife, exacerbated by Grace's influence. Fran's unconventional behavior and outspoken nature challenge the family's norms, particularly those of Grace, who sees herself as the moral compass of the household.

Fran's relationship with Abbott Ashton becomes increasingly significant. Abbott, who is struggling with his own ambitions and the expectations placed upon him, finds himself drawn to Fran's rebellious spirit. However, his ties to Grace and the community's expectations create a conflict within him.

The story unfolds with Fran's attempts to belong and find a home, set against the backdrop of small-town life and its rigid social structures. Her presence forces the characters to confront their own beliefs, desires, and the facades they maintain. As secrets from the past threaten to surface, Fran's determination to carve out a place for herself challenges the status quo, ultimately leading to a reevaluation of relationships and personal truths within the Gregory household and beyond.
