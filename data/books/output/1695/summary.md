In a peculiar suburb of London called Saffron Park, known for its eccentric architecture and artistic pretensions, two poets stand out: Lucian Gregory, a red-haired anarchist, and Gabriel Syme, a poet of order. Gregory, who often lectures on the lawlessness of art, is challenged by Syme, who claims to be a poet of law and respectability. Their ideological clash is set against a backdrop of a vivid sunset that seems to mirror the dramatic tensions between them.

The story unfolds with Syme revealing to Gregory that he is a detective, part of a secret police force dedicated to combating anarchism. This revelation occurs after Gregory, in a moment of misplaced trust, exposes Syme to the inner workings of an anarchist meeting. Syme learns of a council of anarchists each named after a day of the week, with Sunday being the most powerful and enigmatic leader.

Syme's infiltration into the anarchist council as Thursday sets the stage for a series of bizarre and dangerous encounters. The council, which includes characters like the philosophical Monday, the tragic Gogol (Tuesday), and the sinister Secretary, is planning a significant act of terror. Syme discovers that many of his fellow council members are also undercover detectives, each believing themselves to be the sole spy in the group.

The narrative weaves through a series of surreal and comedic events, as Syme and his allies, including the energetic Dr. Bull and the elderly Professor de Worms, attempt to thwart the council's plans while maintaining their own covers. Each member of the council is revealed to be more than they seem, contributing to a growing sense of paranoia and absurdity.

As the detectives pursue the anarchists across London and into France, they are constantly shadowed by the looming presence of Sunday, whose true nature remains a mystery. The chase leads to a climactic confrontation where identities are unmasked, revealing that all members of the council, except for Sunday, are detectives. This revelation underscores the novel's theme of the thin line between order and chaos.

The story culminates in a philosophical discourse on the nature of anarchy and order, with Sunday embodying the ultimate enigmaâ€”an omnipotent figure whose motivations are inscrutable. The detectives' quest becomes a metaphysical exploration of fear, freedom, and the human condition, leaving readers to ponder the complexities of identity and belief in a world where appearances are perpetually deceiving.
