- Relationship: Evolution of Mr. Harding's relationship with the bedesmen",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of each atomic part:
   a. ""Despite Mr. Harding's personal generosity in increasing the bedesmen's allowance"": This part is grounded in Chapter 1, event 5, where Mr. Harding decides to add twopence a day to each bedesman's allowance from his own pocket.
   b. ""some bedesmen support a petition against him"": This part is grounded in Chapter 4, events 1-5, where Finney stirs up discontent among the bedesmen, leading to some of them supporting a petition for higher allowances.
   c. ""he still gathers all of them for a farewell meeting to explain his reasons for leaving"": This part is grounded in Chapter 20, event 4, where Mr. Harding gathers the bedesmen for a farewell meeting to explain his departure.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. Despite Mr. Harding's generosity, some bedesmen still support a petition against him, yet he maintains his integrity by gathering them for a farewell meeting. This shows a contrast between his actions and the bedesmen's response, highlighting his character.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly supported by the events in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it aligns with Mr. Harding's character and the events leading to his resignation.

   a. ""Due to Mr. Harding's refusal to increase the bedesmen's allowance"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline or book summary. In Chapter 1, Mr. Harding actually decides to add twopence a day to each bedesman's allowance from his own pocket, despite opposition.
   b. ""all bedesmen support a petition against him"": This part is not entirely accurate. In Chapter 4, it is mentioned that Abel Handy leads a group of bedesmen in support of the petition, but Bunce and two others remain loyal to the warden, indicating not all bedesmen support the petition.
   c. ""he still gathers the loyal ones for a farewell meeting to explain his reasons for staying"": This part is partially grounded. In Chapter 20, Mr. Harding gathers the bedesmen for a farewell meeting to explain his reasons for leaving, not staying.
