    b. ""while still providing support through actions like lending warm clothing"": This part is grounded in Chapter 16, where Miss Blake lends Nan a sealskin hood and gloves for the sleigh ride, showing her support despite her disapproval of the activity.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. It shows a progression in Miss Blake's approach to guiding Nan, from making decisions for her to supporting her choices while still providing care and protection.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly supported by the events in the chapter outlines.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline. The summary describes Miss Blake as kind and understanding, which aligns with her supportive actions in the chapter outlines.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Miss Blake's approach to guiding Nan evolves from allowing Nan to make her own choices"": This part is partially grounded in the chapter outlines. In Chapter 15, Miss Blake initially tries to prevent Nan from going on the sleigh ride but eventually leaves the decision up to her, indicating a level of choice.
   b. ""to strictly controlling her decisions"": This part is not supported by the chapter outlines. In fact, Miss Blake releases Nan from her promise, which suggests she is not strictly controlling Nan's decisions.
   c. ""while still providing support through actions like lending warm clothing"": This part is grounded in Chapter 16, where Miss Blake lends Nan a sealskin hood and gloves.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid. The claim suggests a progression from allowing choices to strict control, but the chapter outlines do not support this progression. Instead, they show Miss Blake allowing Nan to make her own decision about the sleigh ride.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline. The claim assumes a shift in Miss Blake's approach that is not evidenced by the provided information.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline. The actions described do not indicate a shift to strict control.

Since 1b., 2a., and 2b. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
