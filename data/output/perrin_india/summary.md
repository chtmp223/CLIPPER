In a small west-country parish in the early 1890s, Stella Carrington, a spirited seventeen-year-old, feels suffocated by her life with her authoritarian grandmother and two aunts. Her childhood friend, Maud Verrall, returns from a long absence transformed into a fashionable young lady, igniting Stella's desire for change and adventure. During a church service, Stella realizes the hypocrisy of a hymn that speaks of accepting one's lot in life, contrasting it with her own yearning for freedom and excitement.

Stella's life takes a dramatic turn when she is expelled from Miss Ogle's school for a minor indiscretion involving a young man. Her family, mortified by the scandal, turns to her godfather, Colonel Robert Crayfield, for guidance. Crayfield, a commanding figure in India, visits The Chestnuts and is captivated by Stella's beauty and spirit. He proposes to take her to India as his wife, offering her the escape she has longed for. Despite the age difference and her family's reservations, Stella eagerly accepts, enchanted by the prospect of a new life in India.

In India, Stella's initial excitement is tempered by the realities of her marriage and the oppressive heat of Rassih, a remote station where Crayfield holds a significant administrative position. She quickly learns the complexities of her new environment, including the dynamics with her husband's devoted but jealous servant, Sher Singh, and the expectations of her role as the Commissioner's wife. Stella's beauty and charm attract attention, particularly from Philip Flint, a young and ambitious civil servant recently assigned to Rassih.

Flint and Stella form a close friendship, bonded by their shared love for India and their dissatisfaction with their respective situations. Flint, who harbors feelings for Stella, is torn between his career ambitions and his growing attachment to her. Stella, meanwhile, struggles with her feelings for Flint and her loyalty to her husband, who is oblivious to the emotional turmoil his young wife is experiencing.

As the oppressive heat intensifies, tensions rise. Crayfield becomes ill, and suspicions of poisoning arise, with Sher Singh as a potential culprit. During Crayfield's delirium, Stella learns of his past indiscretions and the dark history of their home, which was the site of a mutiny massacre. These revelations, combined with her own inner conflict and the oppressive environment, push Stella to the brink.

Crayfield's sudden death, under mysterious circumstances, leaves Stella in a precarious position. Flint, who has been a steadfast friend, offers his love and support, but Stella, scarred physically and emotionally, feels unworthy and retreats into isolation. Eventually, she returns to England, where she finds solace in the familiar surroundings of The Chestnuts, though her dreams of India and a life of adventure remain unfulfilled.

The narrative explores themes of desire, duty, and the constraints of societal expectations, set against the backdrop of colonial India. Stella's journey from a restless village girl to a disillusioned young woman highlights the complexities of personal freedom and the sacrifices often required to achieve it.
