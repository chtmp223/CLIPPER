In the narrative, we follow the journey of a man referred to as "my father," who returns to the fictional land of Erewhon after an absence of twenty years. The story begins with his arrival in the colony, where he prepares for a journey into the interior by purchasing a horse and packing supplies. He travels through a landscape that has changed little since his first visit, reflecting on the economic challenges the area faces due to a fall in wool prices and the failure to establish a frozen meat trade.

As he approaches the mountainous region leading to Erewhon, he encounters a shepherd who warns him of the dangers of the river and the mysterious disappearances of explorers. Undeterred, my father continues his journey, crossing rivers and navigating the treacherous terrain. He camps overnight, reflecting on the passage of time and the failures he has faced in the intervening years. Despite these reflections, he remains hopeful and determined to reach Erewhon once more.

The narrative then shifts to a discussion of the religious and philosophical beliefs that have emerged in Erewhon since my father's departure. Dr. Gurgoyle, a prominent figure in the new religious movement, has distorted my father's teachings to fit his own agenda. He argues against the traditional belief in bodily resurrection, instead promoting the idea of a vicarious life lived through the influence one has on others. This belief, he claims, is more comforting and motivating than the traditional notions of heaven and hell.

As my father continues his journey, he reflects on the changes in Erewhonian society, including the rise of Sunchildism, a religion that has elevated him to the status of a divine figure. This transformation is largely due to the miraculous nature of his balloon ascent, which has been interpreted as a supernatural event. Despite his discomfort with this deification, my father is curious to see how his legacy has been interpreted and institutionalized.

Upon reaching the town of Sunch'ston, my father discovers a new temple dedicated to him and learns of the upcoming dedication ceremony. He is conflicted about whether to reveal his true identity, knowing that doing so could disrupt the religious and social order that has developed in his absence. Ultimately, he decides to remain anonymous, observing the ceremony and the sermon delivered by Professor Hanky, a key figure in the Sunchild movement.

Throughout the narrative, my father encounters various characters who reflect the diverse perspectives and motivations within Erewhonian society. These include the skeptical Yram, who was once romantically involved with him, and George, a young man who bears a striking resemblance to my father and is later revealed to be his son. As my father grapples with the implications of his past actions and the unintended consequences of his legacy, he is forced to confront questions of identity, truth, and the nature of influence.

In the end, my father decides to return to his own world, leaving behind the complexities of Erewhonian society. The story concludes with a reflection on the nature of life and death, emphasizing the enduring impact of one's actions and the interconnectedness of all living beings. Throughout the narrative, themes of belief, identity, and the passage of time are explored, offering a rich tapestry of philosophical and existential questions.
