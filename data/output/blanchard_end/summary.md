On a small, picturesque island off the coast of Maine, the lives of the residents and summer visitors intertwine in a tapestry of personal challenges, relationships, and self-discovery. At the heart of the story is Gwen Whitridge, a young woman who arrives with her aunt, Miss Elliott, to spend the summer in their newly built cottage, aptly named Wits' End.

Gwen is a spirited and observant young woman, eager to explore the island and its community. Her aunt, Miss Elliott, is a practical and nurturing figure, who has recently returned from years of missionary work in China. As they settle into island life, they encounter a variety of characters, each with their own stories and secrets.

Luther Williams, a long-time resident of the island, is a quiet and kind fisherman who has lived with the Tibbett family for years. His mysterious past and gentle demeanor intrigue Gwen, and they form a close friendship. Luther becomes a confidant and mentor to Gwen, offering her guidance and support as she navigates her summer on the island.

Kenneth Hilary, a young artist, is also spending the summer on the island with his sister. He and Gwen share a mutual attraction, but Kenneth's financial struggles and family obligations weigh heavily on him. He is torn between pursuing his passion for art and the pressure to provide for his family. Gwen, too, is faced with the dilemma of choosing between a life of comfort and her growing feelings for Kenneth.

Cephas Mitchell, a wealthy but somewhat superficial visitor, provides a contrast to Kenneth. He is staying with the Gray sisters and quickly becomes a part of the social scene on the island. His presence forces Gwen to confront her own values and desires, as she considers what she truly wants in life.

As the summer progresses, Gwen and Kenneth's relationship deepens, but they both understand the practical challenges they face. Meanwhile, the island's community deals with its own dramas, including the youthful romance between Ora Tibbett and Manny Green, which is met with concern by Ora's family due to Manny's uncertain prospects.

Miss Elliott, who has been a guiding force for Gwen, reveals her own plans to return to China to marry a long-time love, a missionary who needs her support. This decision underscores the theme of sacrifice and the pursuit of personal happiness.

The story reaches a poignant climax when Luther Williams, who has harbored a significant secret, is gravely injured while trying to save a fellow islander. On his deathbed, he confesses to Miss Elliott that he is actually Gwen's father, who was believed to have drowned years ago. He had fled to protect the family from scandal and has been living under an assumed name. His passing leaves Gwen with a legacy that allows her and Kenneth to consider a future together without financial worry.

In the end, Gwen and Kenneth's love, tempered by the trials of the summer, promises a hopeful future. The island, with its natural beauty and close-knit community, has provided a backdrop for personal growth and the forging of lasting bonds. As the season ends, Gwen reflects on the unexpected events that have shaped her summer, grateful for the love and friendship she has found.
