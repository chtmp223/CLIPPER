The story revolves around Harvey Cheyne, a spoiled and wealthy fifteen-year-old boy, who falls overboard from a luxury liner in the North Atlantic. He is rescued by a fishing schooner, "We're Here," captained by Disko Troop. The crew includes Disko's son Dan, Long Jack, Tom Platt, Manuel, Uncle Salters, Penn, and the cook. Initially, Harvey is arrogant and refuses to work, but after being knocked down by Disko, he decides to adapt to the life of a fisherman.

Harvey learns the ropes of fishing, becomes friends with Dan, and earns the respect of the crew. He discovers the harsh realities of the fishing life, including the dangers of the sea and the camaraderie among the fishermen. The schooner encounters various challenges, including fog, storms, and a ghostly encounter with a dead French sailor. Despite the hardships, Harvey grows fond of the life and the crew.

Meanwhile, Harvey's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Cheyne, are devastated by his disappearance. Mrs. Cheyne is inconsolable, while Mr. Cheyne, a multimillionaire, is overwhelmed by his responsibilities and the loss of his son. When they receive a telegram from Harvey, they are overjoyed and immediately arrange to travel to Gloucester, where the "We're Here" is headed.

Upon reaching Gloucester, Harvey is reunited with his parents, who are amazed by his transformation. Mr. Cheyne is grateful to Disko and the crew for saving his son and offers to take Dan under his wing, promising to provide for his education and future. Harvey's parents are impressed by the fishermen's resilience and hospitality, and Mrs. Cheyne is particularly moved by the kindness and simplicity of their lives.

The story concludes with Harvey's parents offering to take him back to their life of luxury, but Harvey, now matured and responsible, has gained a new perspective on life. The experience has taught him the value of hard work, friendship, and humility. The Cheynes express their gratitude to the crew, and Harvey leaves with his parents, forever changed by his time on the "We're Here."
