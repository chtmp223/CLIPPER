The narrative begins with a journey westward undertaken by a young boy, referred to as "I," and his guardian, Uncle Eben Holden, after a tragedy leaves the boy an orphan. Traveling from Vermont to the St. Lawrence Valley, they face hardships but find solace in each other's company and the natural world around them. Uncle Eb, a kind-hearted, imaginative bachelor, invents stories of mythical creatures like "swifts" to entertain and educate the boy, instilling in him a healthy fear of the woods to keep him safe.

Their journey is marked by encounters with various characters, including the mysterious "night man," who helps them in their time of need. Eventually, they find refuge with the Brower family in Paradise Valley. David and Elizabeth Brower, along with their daughter Hope, welcome them into their home. The boy quickly bonds with Hope, and they become inseparable friends. Uncle Eb becomes a beloved member of the Brower household, contributing his talents and stories to the community.

As the boy grows, he experiences the simple joys and challenges of rural life, including the annual sugar-making season and the thrill of exploring the woods. He also learns about the broader world through the stories of Jed Feary, the local poet, and the wisdom of Uncle Eb. The boy's education continues, and he develops a love for reading and writing, encouraged by the Browers and his own ambitions.

As he matures, the boy faces new challenges and opportunities. He attends college and becomes involved in the political and social issues of the day, including the growing tensions leading to the Civil War. Throughout these experiences, his love for Hope deepens, despite the distance and time apart. Hope, in turn, pursues her own dreams, studying music in New York and Europe.

The narrative weaves through themes of love, loss, and the passage of time, highlighting the enduring bonds of family and friendship. Uncle Eb remains a central figure, offering guidance and humor, while the boy navigates the complexities of adulthood and the pursuit of his dreams.

In the end, the boy, now a young man, returns to the Brower home, where he and Hope finally acknowledge their love for each other. The story concludes with a sense of fulfillment and the promise of a shared future, grounded in the values and experiences that have shaped their lives. The narrative is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the enduring power of love and community.
