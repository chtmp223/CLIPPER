In August 1672, the city of The Hague is in turmoil as the Dutch people, disillusioned with the Republic led by John de Witt, turn their support to the Stadtholderate and Prince William of Orange. Amidst this political upheaval, Cornelius de Witt, brother of John, is falsely accused of plotting against the Prince and is tortured but remains steadfast in his innocence. Cornelius van Baerle, a wealthy and peaceful tulip enthusiast in Dordrecht, becomes unknowingly involved in this political intrigue when he receives a parcel from his godfather, Cornelius de Witt, containing sensitive correspondence. Van Baerle is arrested and imprisoned in The Hague, where he is despised by his jailer, Gryphus, but finds solace in his love for Gryphus's daughter, Rosa.

Rosa, who is sympathetic to Van Baerle, helps him secretly grow a black tulip, a horticultural marvel that could win a prize of a hundred thousand guilders. Meanwhile, Isaac Boxtel, Van Baerle's envious neighbor, spies on him and plots to steal the black tulip. Boxtel's jealousy drives him to inform the authorities about Van Baerle's possession of the incriminating letters, leading to Van Baerle's arrest.

Despite the political chaos and personal betrayals, Rosa and Van Baerle's affection grows. Rosa, determined to save Van Baerle and his tulip, devises a plan to smuggle the flower to the Horticultural Society in Haarlem. The tulip blooms, and Rosa enters it into the competition under Van Baerle's name. However, Boxtel also claims the tulip as his own, leading to a confrontation.

Amidst this, the political climate shifts as John and Cornelius de Witt are murdered by an angry mob, incited by the political machinations of William of Orange. Van Baerle, initially sentenced to death, is pardoned by the Prince, who recognizes his innocence and the injustice done to him. The Prince awards the prize for the black tulip to Rosa, acknowledging her courage and dedication.

In the end, Van Baerle is freed, his property restored, and he marries Rosa. They live happily, cultivating tulips and raising a family, while Boxtel, consumed by his own envy, meets a tragic end. The story highlights themes of love, innocence, envy, and the tumultuous nature of political power.
