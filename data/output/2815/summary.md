Mrs. Lightfoot Lee, a widow from New York, decides to spend the winter in Washington, seeking a change from her monotonous life and searching for a sense of purpose. Her husband has been dead for five years, and she finds herself disillusioned with New York society and the superficial pursuits of wealth and status. Despite her wealth and social standing, Mrs. Lee is restless and ambitious, yearning for something more meaningful.

In Washington, Mrs. Lee becomes acquainted with various political figures and socialites. She is particularly intrigued by Senator Silas P. Ratcliffe, a powerful and ambitious politician from Illinois, who is considered a potential candidate for the presidency. Ratcliffe is a skilled political operator, and Mrs. Lee is drawn to his influence and the possibility of understanding the machinery of government through him.

As Mrs. Lee navigates Washington society, she is accompanied by her younger sister, Sybil Ross, who is more interested in social engagements and less in politics. Sybil is charming and lively, and she attracts attention from various admirers, including Mr. Schneidekoupon, a wealthy and eccentric young man from New York.

Mrs. Lee's circle of acquaintances expands to include John Carrington, a lawyer from Virginia with a tragic past, who becomes a close friend and confidant. Carrington is in love with Mrs. Lee but is aware that her ambitions and interests lie elsewhere. He watches with concern as she becomes more entangled with Ratcliffe.

Ratcliffe, meanwhile, is navigating his own political landscape. He is approached by various factions seeking his support, and he carefully maneuvers to maintain his influence. He is aware of the potential threat posed by the new President, who is determined to assert his independence and curtail Ratcliffe's power.

As Ratcliffe and Mrs. Lee's relationship develops, she is torn between her attraction to his power and her growing awareness of the moral compromises he makes. Ratcliffe, for his part, is genuinely attracted to Mrs. Lee and sees her as a potential partner who could help him achieve his political ambitions.

The narrative explores themes of ambition, power, and the moral complexities of political life. Mrs. Lee's journey is one of self-discovery as she grapples with her own values and desires. She is forced to confront the reality of political life and the personal sacrifices it demands.

Throughout the story, Mrs. Lee is portrayed as a woman of intelligence and depth, seeking to find her place in a world dominated by male power and ambition. Her interactions with Ratcliffe, Carrington, and other characters illuminate the challenges faced by women in navigating societal expectations and personal aspirations.

In the end, Mrs. Lee's experiences in Washington lead her to question her ambitions and the path she has chosen. The novel leaves her future uncertain, reflecting the complexities and uncertainties of both personal and political life.
