    b. ""Watson resolves to publish the true account of the case in his journal"": This part is grounded in event 7 of Chapter 14.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is meaningful and valid. The newspaper article crediting Lestrade and Gregson likely motivates Watson to publish the true account, as it is a direct response to the article's misattribution.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as Watson's decision to publish is a reaction to the article.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID."
