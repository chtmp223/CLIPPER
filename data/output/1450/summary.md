Pollyanna Whittier, an optimistic and spirited eleven-year-old girl, becomes an orphan after the death of her father, a missionary minister. She is sent to live with her stern Aunt Polly Harrington in the town of Beldingsville, Vermont. Aunt Polly is a wealthy, no-nonsense woman who prides herself on her duty-bound lifestyle. Pollyanna's arrival is met with a mix of curiosity and skepticism by the townspeople, as they are not accustomed to her exuberant and positive outlook on life.

Pollyanna's philosophy of life is centered around a game her father taught her, known as the "Glad Game," where she finds something to be glad about in every situation, no matter how bleak. This game becomes a central theme in the story as Pollyanna spreads her infectious optimism throughout the town, touching the lives of many, including her Aunt Polly, who is initially resistant to her niece's cheerful disposition.

Pollyanna quickly becomes acquainted with various townsfolk, including Nancy, the maid at her aunt's house, who becomes a close confidante. She also meets Old Tom, the gardener, and his son Timothy, who are charmed by her positivity. Pollyanna's interactions extend beyond the household as she befriends John Pendleton, a reclusive and wealthy man with a mysterious past linked to her own family. Despite his initial gruff demeanor, Pollyanna's sunny nature gradually warms his heart, and he becomes one of her staunchest supporters.

Another significant relationship is with Mrs. Snow, a bedridden woman who is perpetually dissatisfied with life. Pollyanna's visits and her insistence on finding something to be glad about help transform Mrs. Snow's outlook, bringing a semblance of joy and purpose to her life. Pollyanna also encounters the local minister, Rev. Paul Ford, whose sermons are transformed by her influence, encouraging his congregation to embrace positivity.

The narrative takes a dramatic turn when Pollyanna is struck by a car, resulting in a severe spinal injury that leaves her unable to walk. This event tests Pollyanna's own ability to play the Glad Game, as she struggles to find something to be glad about in her new reality. The townspeople, who have been touched by Pollyanna's optimism, rally around her, each trying to offer something that might bring her joy and encouragement.

Amidst this crisis, Aunt Polly undergoes a transformation. She realizes the depth of her love for Pollyanna and regrets her previous coldness. This change is further catalyzed by the re-emergence of Dr. Chilton, a local physician who had a past romantic relationship with Aunt Polly. Pollyanna inadvertently rekindles their affection, leading to their eventual reconciliation and engagement.

In the climax, Dr. Chilton arranges for a specialist to examine Pollyanna, offering a glimmer of hope for her recovery. Pollyanna's unwavering spirit and the support of the community ultimately lead to a miraculous improvement in her condition. She takes her first steps, symbolizing the triumph of positivity and love over adversity.

The story concludes with Pollyanna's gratitude not only for the ability to walk again but also for the profound impact she has had on those around her. Her journey from an orphaned girl to a beloved member of the community highlights the transformative power of optimism and kindness. Aunt Polly, now softened and open-hearted, looks forward to a future filled with love and family, thanks in large part to her niece's unyielding belief in the Glad Game.
