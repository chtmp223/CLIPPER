The narrative begins with Ranald Bannerman, a young boy growing up in a rural Scottish parish, recounting his childhood experiences. His father, a solemn and gentle clergyman, oversees a small parish, and Ranald is one of four sons in the family. The family lives a simple life, supplemented by farming to make ends meet. Ranald's mother is an invalid, and much of the household's daily management falls to Mrs. Mitchell, the grim and unfriendly housekeeper, whom the children dislike. In contrast, Kirsty, who manages the farm's household, is beloved by the children for her kindness and storytelling.

Ranald's early years are marked by freedom and adventure, exploring the countryside and engaging in various escapades with his brothers and their friend Turkey, the farm's cowherd. Turkey is an older boy, full of practical knowledge and courage, who becomes a close companion and mentor to Ranald. The boys often find themselves at odds with Mrs. Mitchell, who is strict and often complains about them to their father.

As Ranald grows, he begins to attend school, first under the stern and unkind Mrs. Shand, whom he quickly escapes from, and later under Kirsty's informal tutelage. Kirsty teaches Ranald and his brothers to read, fostering a love for learning and storytelling in the children. Ranald's father, though busy with his parish duties, is a guiding presence in his life, teaching him about faith, morality, and the importance of doing right.

Ranald's adventures include encounters with the local folklore, such as stories of kelpies and other mythical creatures, often told by Kirsty. These tales fuel the children's imaginations and provide a backdrop to their rural life. One significant adventure involves Ranald and Turkey attempting to uncover the dishonest practices of Mrs. Mitchell, who is suspected of stealing from the poor. Their investigation leads to Mrs. Mitchell's departure, and Kirsty takes over her duties, much to the children's delight.

As Ranald matures, he becomes more aware of the complexities of life and relationships. He develops a fondness for Elsie Duff, a sweet and gentle girl from the village, and spends time with her and Turkey, who also harbors feelings for Elsie. This innocent affection is part of Ranald's journey from boyhood to adolescence.

Eventually, Ranald leaves home to attend a grammar school in the county town and later prepares for university. During his studies, he returns home to find that Elsie has died, a loss that deeply affects him and Turkey, revealing the depth of Turkey's feelings for her. This event marks a turning point for Ranald, signifying the end of his childhood and the beginning of his adult life.

The narrative closes with Ranald reflecting on the lessons he learned from his father, Turkey, and his experiences in the Scottish countryside, shaping him into the person he has become. Through the joys and challenges of his early years, Ranald gains a sense of identity and purpose, rooted in the values of kindness, courage, and integrity.
