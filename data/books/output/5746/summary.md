Allan Quatermain, now an elderly man, recounts one of his most peculiar adventures. Despite his advancing age, he finds himself embroiled in a tale of intrigue, danger, and ancient mysteries. This story begins as Quatermain reflects on the nature of life and death, pondering whether it is better to live or die and musing on the reluctance of even the most devout to embrace death. He then delves into the narrative of his adventure, which he recorded during his idle hours in a strange landâ€”England.

The adventure begins with a recollection of a journey he undertook with Lord Ragnall, whose wife had been kidnapped in Egypt. The kidnappers were priests of a tribe who believed her to be the priestess of their worship due to a birthmark resembling a young moon on her breast. This worship was rooted in Ancient Egyptian beliefs, and the tribe saw her as a personification of the goddess Isis. The expedition to rescue her was fraught with danger, but ultimately successful. Before leaving the Kendah country, Lady Ragnall was given ancient papyrus rolls and a herb called Taduki, known for inducing visions or clairvoyance.

Quatermain recalls a conversation with Lady Ragnall about the Taduki, where she suggested that they might one day use it to see visions of their past or future lives. This idea resurfaces when Quatermain attends a charity dinner and meets a scientist who studies herbs with similar properties. Intrigued by the possibilities, Quatermain considers experimenting with Taduki.

The narrative shifts to Quatermain's return to England, where he is drawn back into the world of adventure when he receives a letter from Lady Ragnall. She invites him to Ragnall Castle, where she reveals that her husband, Lord Ragnall, died in Egypt during an excavation of a temple dedicated to Isis. This temple, remarkably well-preserved due to being buried in sand, contained a statue of Isis that had been destroyed in a sand collapse, killing Lord Ragnall.

Lady Ragnall is deeply affected by these events and believes that the Taduki might hold the key to understanding their shared past and its connection to the ancient Egyptian mysteries. Despite his initial reluctance, Quatermain is persuaded to partake in the Taduki ritual with Lady Ragnall. The experience transports them into a vision of their past lives, where Quatermain is a noble Egyptian named Shabaka, and Lady Ragnall is Amada, a priestess of Isis.

In this vision, Shabaka is entangled in political and romantic intrigue involving the Great King of the East, who desires Amada for his harem. Shabaka's journey is filled with peril, including a lion hunt that tests his mettle and a wager with the King that places his life and the lives of others at stake. Through cunning and bravery, Shabaka navigates these challenges, aided by his loyal servant Bes, who is revealed to be a king in his own right.

The vision reveals the complexities of love, duty, and destiny as Shabaka strives to protect Amada and his homeland from foreign domination. The Taduki experience leaves Quatermain and Lady Ragnall with a deeper understanding of their past and the forces that have shaped their lives across the centuries.

The story concludes with Quatermain reflecting on the nature of fate and the interconnectedness of their lives, both past and present. Despite the dangers and uncertainties, he finds solace in the knowledge that their shared journey has brought them closer to the truth of their existence.
