   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it follows a logical sequence of events in Anne's interactions with Roy Gardner.

Since all atomic parts are grounded in the chapter outline, and the relationship between them is valid and meaningful, the claim is consistent with the provided information.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Anne's relationship with Roy Gardner progresses from their first meeting at a dance"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. Anne and Roy's first meeting is described in Chapter 25, where they meet in the park, not at a dance.
   b. ""to attending a reception together"": This part is grounded in Chapter 26, where Anne and Roy attend the Junior-Senior reception together.
   c. ""culminating in Roy's proposal in the school garden"": This part is partially grounded in Chapter 38, where Roy proposes to Anne, but it occurs in the pavilion on the harbor shore, not in the school garden.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not entirely valid because the claim inaccurately describes the progression of Anne and Roy's relationship. The first meeting is incorrectly stated as occurring at a dance, and the location of the proposal is inaccurately described as the school garden.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation but is based on incorrect details from the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship does not contradict the overall narrative of Anne's relationship with Roy, but the inaccuracies in the details make the claim misleading.

Since the claim contains inaccuracies in the details of the events, it is not fully grounded in the chapter outline, making it INVALID."
