Caius Simpson, the only son of a well-to-do farmer on the northwest coast of Prince Edward's Island, is raised with strict puritanical values, which instill in him a sense of moral superiority and ambition. His father, who does not wish Caius to follow in his farming footsteps, sends him to an academy, where Caius excels in his studies. Despite his academic success, Caius struggles with the practicalities of life, as his education has deprived him of real-world experiences. 

One summer, Caius encounters a mysterious sea-maiden while walking along the shore. The ethereal figure, part human and part fish, beckons to him from the water. Caius is captivated by her beauty and the enigma she represents. This encounter haunts him, filling his mind with questions about reality, imagination, and the nature of the soul. He becomes obsessed with the idea of the sea-maiden, believing that she is the spirit of a young child who drowned years ago.

As Caius grows older, he pursues a career in medicine, driven by his father's ambitions for him. He studies diligently, eventually earning his degree and planning to further his education in Europe. However, before he leaves, he returns home for the summer, where he is once again drawn to the sea and the memory of the mysterious maiden.

During his stay, Caius learns that Day's wife, who had been sent to an asylum after drowning her child in a fit of madness, has been released and returned home. Her presence reignites Caius's curiosity about the drowned child and the sea-maiden. Caius visits the shore frequently, hoping to see the sea-maiden again. He is torn between his rational understanding of the world and the inexplicable vision he has witnessed.

Caius's internal struggle is mirrored by his interactions with his family and community. He feels disconnected from their simple, practical lives and their inability to comprehend his experiences and aspirations. His mother, eager for him to marry and settle down, is unaware of the depth of his internal conflict. Caius's cousin Mabel, who visits during his stay, represents the conventional life he is expected to lead, but he feels no real connection to her.

As the summer progresses, Caius becomes increasingly introspective, contemplating the nature of reality and the possibility of the supernatural. He is haunted by the vision of the sea-maiden, which symbolizes a world of beauty and mystery beyond the mundane. His experiences lead him to question the rigid moral framework he was raised with and to seek a deeper understanding of life and love.

Ultimately, Caius's story is one of self-discovery and the search for meaning in a world that often seems at odds with one's inner experiences. The sea-maiden, whether real or imagined, serves as a catalyst for Caius's transformation, challenging him to reconcile his dreams with reality and to find his place in the world.
