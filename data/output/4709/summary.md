Montgomery Brewster, a young man from New York, finds himself in an extraordinary situation when he inherits a million dollars from his grandfather, Edwin Peter Brewster. This wealth is unencumbered, and Monty is free to spend it as he wishes. However, shortly after receiving this windfall, Monty learns of another potential inheritance from his long-lost uncle, James T. Sedgwick, who has left him seven million dollars. The catch is that to claim this fortune, Monty must be penniless on his twenty-sixth birthday, a year from the time he receives the news. The challenge is to spend his grandfather's million without accruing any assets or debts, and without revealing his predicament to anyone.

Monty embarks on a year of extravagant spending with the help of his friends, including "Nopper" Harrison, Elon Gardner, and Joe Bragdon, who become his aides in this unusual quest. He throws lavish parties, rents expensive apartments, and indulges in luxurious purchases, all while trying to maintain the appearance of a carefree millionaire. His spending habits attract attention and criticism, and he becomes the subject of gossip and speculation in New York society.

Throughout the year, Monty struggles with the challenge of spending money wisely and within the constraints set by his uncle's will. He faces numerous obstacles, including the disappearance of Swearengen Jones, the executor of his uncle's estate, which threatens to derail his plans. Despite these challenges, Monty remains determined to meet the conditions of the will.

In the midst of his financial adventures, Monty grapples with personal relationships, particularly with Peggy Gray, a childhood friend, and Barbara Drew, a woman he becomes romantically interested in. Monty's feelings for Peggy grow, and he eventually realizes that she is the one he truly loves. However, he is aware that he cannot pursue a serious relationship until his financial situation is resolved.

As the year progresses, Monty continues his spending spree, throwing extravagant dinners, investing in elaborate ventures, and even organizing a carnival. He navigates the complexities of society life, balancing friendships and romantic interests while adhering to the stipulations of the will. Despite the challenges, Monty remains focused on his goal, driven by the promise of a future with Peggy and the hope of securing the larger inheritance.

As the deadline approaches, Monty faces the final test of his resolve. He manages to spend the entire million, leaving himself penniless on the eve of his twenty-sixth birthday. In the end, Monty's perseverance pays off. Swearengen Jones reappears, having tested Monty's character and judgment throughout the year. Satisfied with Monty's ability to handle wealth responsibly, Jones grants him the full inheritance from Uncle James.

With his financial future secured and his love for Peggy affirmed, Monty Brewster emerges from the year of challenges as a wiser and more mature man, ready to embrace a life of prosperity and happiness with the woman he loves.
