James Elliot, a recent medical graduate, embarks on a 25-mile walk to Alton to work as an assistant to Doctor Thomas Gordon, known as "Doc." Gordon. James is eager to begin his career in medicine, encouraged by his well-to-do father, a successful peach grower and mayor of Gresham. James's journey is filled with youthful energy and optimism, despite the chilly morning and the long distance.

James's arrival in Alton introduces him to a cast of characters, including the enigmatic Doctor Gordon and his household.

James is immediately captivated by Mrs. Ewing's beauty and grace.

The household is shrouded in secrecy, and James soon learns that not everything is as it seems. Clemency, initially a vibrant young woman, is kept indoors due to an unspecified danger.

Despite the danger, James and Clemency develop a close bond, and he becomes protective of her.

As James settles into his role, he witnesses Doctor Gordon's erratic behavior, shifting from jovial camaraderie to deep gloom. Gordon is burdened by a secret that weighs heavily on him, affecting his professional and personal life. The narrative gradually reveals that Gordon has been living a complex dual life, with Mrs. Ewing being his wife, not his sister, as the town believes. This revelation is forced by the circumstances surrounding Mrs. Ewing's death, which is hastened by Gordon's administration of morphine to alleviate her suffering.

The story culminates in a confrontation with the mysterious man, leading to a resolution of the immediate danger, but leaving lasting impacts on all involved.
