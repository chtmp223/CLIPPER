In the book, we are introduced to Jimmy Pitt, a wealthy and restless young man in New York who has recently returned from a European trip. Jimmy is a man of action, accustomed to challenges, and finds himself bored with the monotony of his affluent lifestyle. One evening at the Strollers' Club, a conversation about burglary leads to a bet that Jimmy, despite his lack of criminal experience, could successfully break into a house. This impulsive wager sets the stage for a series of events that intertwine his life with those of other pivotal characters.

Jimmy's target is the home of Police-Captain McEachern, a man with a dubious past who has amassed wealth through graft and now dreams of entering English society with his daughter, Molly. Molly, a spirited and independent young woman, becomes the central figure in Jimmy's life after a chance meeting on the Lusitania, where he falls for her at first sight. However, Jimmy's attempts to reconnect with her are complicated by her father's suspicions and the presence of Spike Mullins, a Bowery boy who assists Jimmy in his bet-driven burglary attempt.

As Jimmy navigates these challenges, he encounters Lord Dreever, a young and somewhat foolish English nobleman who is under the thumb of his wealthy uncle, Sir Thomas Blunt. Sir Thomas, a self-made millionaire, is determined to marry Lord Dreever off to a wealthy bride to secure the familyâ€™s financial future. Unbeknownst to Sir Thomas, Lord Dreever has his own romantic interests, complicating the family dynamics further.

The narrative unfolds with Jimmy's attempt to return a stolen necklace to its rightful place, only to be caught by Sir Thomas. However, Jimmy reveals that the necklace is a fake, a fact that Sir Thomas was desperately trying to keep hidden. This revelation shifts the power dynamics, as Jimmy uses the information to negotiate his standing, ultimately winning over Molly and resolving the misunderstandings with her father.

Throughout the story, themes of love, deception, and social ambition are explored against the backdrop of early 20th-century New York and England. The characters' motivations are driven by a mix of personal desires and societal pressures, leading to humorous and poignant situations. Jimmy's journey from a bored millionaire to a man in love showcases his growth and the importance of taking risks for the things that truly matter. The book concludes with a sense of resolution and new beginnings for Jimmy and Molly, as they prepare to embark on a life together.
