2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship suggests a change in status from leader to captive. However, the outline does not explicitly state that David was a leader of the army; it only mentions his involvement in the battle. Therefore, the relationship is not objectively valid as it assumes a leadership role not explicitly stated.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation, as it assumes a leadership status for David that is not clearly defined in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not contradict the summary or outline, but it is not explicitly supported by them either.

Since 1a. and 2a. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
