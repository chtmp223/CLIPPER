This shows his initial compliance with the system out of self-preservation. However, in Chapter 19, we see a significant transformation in Donnelly's character.

This change demonstrates how the oppressive system eventually turns even those who initially complied with it into revolutionaries.","This corrupted fact contradicts the information provided in the outline.
