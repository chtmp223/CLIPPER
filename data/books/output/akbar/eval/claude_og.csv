"Cyrus, who experienced occasional violent behavior from his gin-drinking father Ali, interprets a flickering light bulb as a potential sign from God.","Cyrus, who experienced occasional violent behavior from his gin-drinking father Ali, interprets a flickering candle as a potential sign from God.",True,True,"<explanation>
The statement is true based on the context provided. The passage describes how Cyrus, lying on his mattress, asks God to reveal Himself by flashing the lights on and off. It then states that the light bulb flickered or got brighter for a fraction of a second, which Cyrus interprets as a potential sign from God. The passage also mentions that Cyrus's father Ali drank gin at night and occasionally exhibited violent behavior, such as slapping Cyrus and ripping his library book in half when Cyrus accidentally woke him. This aligns with the statement's characterization of Ali as a ""gin-drinking father"" who exhibited ""occasional violent behavior.""
</explanation>

<answer>TRUE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement contains some accurate elements but also some inaccuracies when compared to the context provided. The context does mention that Cyrus's father Ali drank gin at night to help him sleep. However, it does not describe ""violent behavior"" from Ali, only one isolated incident where Ali slapped Cyrus and ripped a book when startled awake. The context does describe Cyrus interpreting a flickering light bulb (not a candle) as a potential sign from God, saying ""If every relationship was a series of advances and retreats, Cyrus was almost never the retreat-er, sharing everything important about himself at a word, a smile, with a shrug as if to say, 'Those're just facts. Why should I be ashamed?'"" Therefore, while some elements are correct, the statement contains enough inaccuracies to be considered false overall.

"Cyrus's personal history of alcohol abuse and suicidal thoughts, which he used to cope with grief and emptiness, influences his performance as a medical actor when he deviates from the script.","Cyrus's interest in theater, rather than his personal history of alcohol abuse and suicidal thoughts, influences his performance as a medical actor when he deviates from the script.",True,True,"<explanation>
The statement appears to be true based on the context provided. The passage describes Cyrus's history of alcohol abuse and suicidal thoughts as ways of coping with grief and emptiness. When acting as a medical patient, Cyrus goes off-script and shares personal details about his own suicidal thoughts and alcohol use, rather than sticking to the assigned patient role. For example, he tells the medical student about wanting to light himself on fire while drunk on Everclear. This deviation from the script and insertion of his own experiences suggests his personal history is influencing his performance as a medical actor.
</explanation>

<answer>TRUE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement is false based on the context provided. The passage indicates that Cyrus's personal history and experiences heavily influence his performance as a medical actor, rather than a general interest in theater. Specifically, the text mentions that Cyrus draws on his own experiences with suicidal thoughts and alcohol abuse when interacting with the medical student. He goes off-script to talk about his own struggles with wanting to die and his past attempt to light himself on fire while drunk. This suggests that Cyrus's personal history, not theatrical interests, is what causes him to deviate from the script in his role as a medical actor.

"Roya Shams, believed to have died in the Iran Air Flight 655 incident, actually survived by switching identities with her lover Leila.","Roya Shams, believed to have died in the Iran Air Flight 655 incident, actually survived by switching identities with Sang Linh.",True,True,"<explanation>
The context provides clear evidence that this statement is true. According to the story, Roya Shams did not actually die in the Iran Air Flight 655 incident, but rather switched identities with her lover Leila. This is revealed in several parts of the text, most explicitly when Sang tells Cyrus: ""She gave her ticket to her lover. Leila. They switched passports. They were going to run away separately, meet up, and start life over again. Together. Somewhere else."" The text also reveals that Roya later took on the identity of Orkideh, the artist who Cyrus meets at the museum. This deception allowed Roya to escape her life in Iran and start anew in America, while tragically it was Leila who died in the plane crash using Roya's identity.
</explanation>

<answer>TRUE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement is incorrect based on the context provided. According to the story, Roya Shams (who later became known as the artist Orkideh) survived by switching identities with her lover Leila, not with Sang Linh. Sang Linh was Orkideh's gallerist and former wife, but was not involved in the identity switch related to the Iran Air Flight 655 incident. The context clearly states that Roya gave her passport to Leila, who then boarded the ill-fated flight in Roya's place. Roya (as Orkideh) later developed a relationship with Sang Linh, but this was after she had already assumed a new identity following the plane crash.

The statement is supported by the context provided. When Cyrus arrives at the museum on Monday morning (Day 4), he finds the Death-Speak exhibit closed with a note stating that Orkideh has passed away. The note thanks Orkideh for her final installation and provides information on how to make donations in her memory. This clearly indicates that the exhibit has ended due to Orkideh's death, preventing Cyrus from visiting it as he had planned.
</explanation>

<answer>TRUE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement contains several inaccuracies based on the context provided. First, the art exhibit featuring Orkideh was at the Brooklyn Museum in New York, not in Los Angeles. Second, Cyrus had already visited the exhibit multiple times and spoken with Orkideh before it closed, rather than planning to visit it. The exhibit did close due to Orkideh's passing, but this happened after Cyrus had already interacted with her. These key details make the overall statement false, even though it is correct that the exhibit closed because of Orkideh's death.

The statement is true based on the context provided. Initially, Orkideh meets Cyrus at the Brooklyn Museum and questions him about his Iranian background, not revealing their true relationship. However, later in the story, it is revealed that Orkideh is actually Cyrus's biological mother, Roya Shams. This is disclosed when Cyrus speaks with Sang Linh, Orkideh's former partner and gallerist, who tells him that Orkideh was his mother and had recognized him immediately when he came to the museum. The revelation of this hidden relationship between Orkideh and Cyrus is a major plot point in the story.

The statement appears to be true based on the context provided. In the section describing Arash's experience as an ""angel"" rider during the Iran-Iraq War, it mentions him encountering a dying soldier reciting Ayat al Kursi: ""I see him see me and he bursts into tears, bursts yes like a lotus bursting into a tantrum of blades, he bursts into tears and crying, slopping he begins gurgling through Ayat al Kursi, I can barely make it out it sounds so wet but he slops through"". Later, when Cyrus sees Orkideh's painting ""Dudusch"", it is described as depicting ""a battlefield strewn with dead soldiers"" with ""a giant black horse with the black silhouette of a rider in long black robes"" in the center, matching the description of Arash's role. The painting's title ""Dudusch"" is also explained to mean ""brother"" in Farsi, further connecting it to Arash's experience.

The statement is not entirely accurate based on the context provided. While the painting ""Dudusch"" does depict a scene related to Arash's experience as an ""angel"" rider during the Iran-Iraq War, there is no mention of a soldier singing a song in the description of the painting. The context describes the painting as showing a battlefield strewn with dead soldiers, and in the center, a giant black horse with a rider in black robes. The rider is described as having a halo effect showing a scared naked little boy inside the robes. The painting seems to represent the trauma and vulnerability of Arash's experience, but does not include any details about a singing soldier.

It states that he worked at a chicken farm near Fort Wayne for nearly two decades, and that it was a breeder farm rather than raising chickens for meat. The passage describes the strict biosecurity measures Ali had to follow, including showering and changing into scrubs before entering the barns. It also mentions that Ali developed a habit of drinking gin at night to help him fall asleep.

The statement appears to be true based on the context provided. In the passage, Cyrus deviates from the medical acting script by sharing personal details about his past suicidal thoughts and alcohol abuse. He describes a specific incident where he got drunk on Everclear and contemplated setting himself on fire in a bathtub. Later in the context, it's mentioned that Cyrus began drinking heavily and using drugs after starting college, which coincided with his father's death at the start of his sophomore year. The passage states that Cyrus ""managed what grief he did have, or milked it really, leaned into it, by drinking more, using more."" This aligns with the statement's claim that Cyrus spiraled into addiction after his father's death.
</explanation>

<answer>TRUE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement appears to be false based on the context provided. While Cyrus does deviate from the medical acting script by sharing personal experiences with suicidal thoughts and alcohol abuse, the context does not indicate these were actual experiences from before his father's death. Rather, the passage suggests Cyrus is improvising and going off-script during the medical acting scenario, sharing hypothetical or fictional experiences to provoke a reaction from the medical student. The context mentions Cyrus had trouble paying attention in the meeting and was feeling frustrated, which likely led to his improvised deviation from the script. There is no clear indication that Cyrus actually experienced addiction or suicidal thoughts prior to his father's death based on this excerpt alone.

"The narrative presents conflicting information about Roya's fate, stating her death in the Iran Air Flight 655 incident in one chapter, while describing her as alive and pregnant with Cyrus in another.","The narrative presents conflicting information about Roya's fate, stating her death in the Iran Air Flight 655 incident in one chapter, while describing her as alive and preparing for a trip in another.",False,False,"<explanation>
The statement is false because the narrative intentionally presents conflicting information about Roya's fate as part of the plot. Initially, it's stated that Roya died on Iran Air Flight 655. However, later chapters reveal that Roya actually survived by giving her ticket to her lover Leila, who died in her place. Roya then assumed a new identity as the artist Orkideh and lived in America, eventually reconnecting with her son Cyrus near the end of her life. The apparent contradiction is a deliberate narrative device used to create mystery and reveal the truth gradually, rather than an inconsistency in the story.</explanation>

<answer>FALSE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement is true based on the conflicting information presented in the narrative. In earlier chapters, it is stated that Roya died on Iran Air Flight 655 when it was shot down in 1988. However, later chapters reveal that Roya (who is also Orkideh) actually survived and gave her ticket to her lover Leila, who died in her place. The narrative intentionally presents these conflicting accounts to create mystery around Roya/Orkideh's true fate, which is only revealed later in the story. This contradiction is a key plot point, not an error in the narrative.

The statement is true according to the context provided. The passage describes Cyrus lying on his mattress and asking God to reveal Himself by flashing the light bulb. It then states: ""He was thinking this and then it—something—happened. The light bulb flickered, or maybe it got brighter, like a camera's flash going off across the street, just a fraction of a fraction of a second like that, and then it was back to normal, just a regular yellow bulb."" This directly confirms that after Cyrus's request, the light bulb did indeed flicker or brighten briefly, matching the statement given.

The statement is not entirely accurate based on the context provided. The passage states that Cyrus asked God to reveal Himself by flashing the lights, and then describes what happened: ""The light bulb flickered, or maybe it got brighter, like a camera's flash going off across the street, just a fraction of a fraction of a second like that, and then it was back to normal, just a regular yellow bulb.""

The statement is true based on the context provided. The passage describes Cyrus taking various drugs throughout the day, including ""the standard bouquet of booze, weed, cigarettes, Klonopin, Adderall, Neurontin variously throughout the day."" It then states that Cyrus ""felt pretty sober in fact, relative to his baseline."" After seeing the light flicker, Cyrus explicitly wonders if it was due to ""the sheer weight of his wanting, or his watching, that strained his eyes till they saw what they'd wanted to see."" He also considers whether it could have been God working through ""the tired eyes of drunk Iranians in the American Midwest, through CVS handles of bourbon and little pink pills."" This internal questioning by Cyrus about whether the flickering was due to his intense desire or actual divine intervention matches the statement provided.

<answer>TRUE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement is a mix of accurate and inaccurate information based on the context. Cyrus does question whether the light flickering was due to his desire or divine intervention, which aligns with the statement. However, the context does not mention Cyrus reflecting on drugs he consumed throughout the day. Rather, it lists the drugs he had taken that day as background information, but does not indicate Cyrus was actively reflecting on them in that moment. The statement combines accurate information about Cyrus questioning the light with inaccurate information about him reflecting on his drug use, making it partially true but not entirely accurate.

The context states that Cyrus is playing the role of ""Mrs. Kaufmann"" (not Sandra), who is described as a widowed high school math teacher. Additionally, Dr. Monfort does not deliver news of a brain tumor diagnosis. Instead, the context shows that Cyrus, in character as Mrs. Kaufmann, asks hypothetical questions about patients wanting to die, which derails the intended scenario. The medical student, Dr. Monfort, appears flustered and does not successfully deliver any diagnosis.

The context does describe Cyrus attending an AA meeting at the Camp5 Center. During this meeting, Cyrus does express frustrations about sobriety and the program. Specifically, he talks about how sobriety feels like ""nothing"" to him, how he still feels sad and angry all the time, and how he resists the program. He says things like ""If I'm being rigorously honest, I still think most of you are fucking idiots"" and expresses skepticism about whether the program's language and concepts can really address his deep-seated issues.

Additionally, Ali and Cyrus were not in Tehran after the incident - they had moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana in the United States when Cyrus was still an infant.

The statement contains both true and false elements. It is true that Roya participates in a class discussion about favorite words with Aghaye Ghorbani. However, the statement is incorrect in saying that Roya remains preoccupied with her bed-wetting problem at dinner. The context describes Roya picking at her food during dinner, but does not mention her being preoccupied with bed-wetting at that time. Rather, it states that her family members are talking about various topics while she remains quiet. Since the statement contains this inaccuracy about Roya's thoughts at dinner, it cannot be considered entirely true.

<answer>FALSE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement contains multiple inaccuracies when compared to the context provided. While Roya does participate in a class discussion with Aghaye Ghorbani, it is not about favorite colors but rather favorite words. The teacher is trying to make a point about words ending in vowel sounds being beautiful. Additionally, while Roya is preoccupied with her bed-wetting problem, this is not mentioned in relation to dinner, but rather throughout her daily life, including at school where she worries others can smell it on her. The statement combines some accurate elements (Roya's interaction with her teacher, her preoccupation with bed-wetting) but misrepresents the details and context, making it false overall.

The statement is not supported by the context provided. The passage describes Roya going to bed and praying to wake up dry, but it does not mention her having any dreams, let alone a specific dream about flowers growing from unusual places. The context focuses on Roya's anxiety about wetting the bed and her attempts to prevent it, but does not describe any dreams she has that night. Without any mention of dreams or flowers in the given context, there is no evidence to support the claim made in the statement.
</explanation>

<answer>FALSE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement is not supported by the context provided. The passage describes Roya as a 10-year-old girl who has been wetting the bed. It mentions her going to bed and trying not to drink water before sleeping to avoid wetting the bed. However, there is no mention of Roya praying to wake up dry or having any dream about flying over a desert.

The statement describes an escalation of Arash's behavior towards Roya regarding her bed-wetting, culminating in him urinating on her in bed. While the context does show Arash making cruel comments about Roya's bed-wetting (""Oof, Roya, you smell like a dead cow""), it does not provide any evidence of him urinating on her. The most extreme behavior described is Arash's verbal taunting. The statement goes beyond what is actually depicted in the given context by claiming Arash urinated on Roya, which is not supported by the text.
</explanation>

<answer>FALSE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement is partially true but contains a significant error. The context does describe Arash making cruel comments about Roya's bed-wetting, such as saying she smells like a dead cow. However, the part about Arash urinating in the bathroom is not supported by the text. The passage describes Arash standing over Roya's bed and urinating directly onto her while she was sleeping, not urinating in the bathroom. This is a much more severe and cruel act than what the statement suggests. Because of this major inaccuracy, the statement cannot be considered fully true.

He explains that he wants to write about ""secular, pacifist martyrs"" and people who gave their lives for something larger than themselves.

The statement contains some inaccuracies. While it's true that Sad James shows Cyrus information about Orkideh's exhibit, and Cyrus initially dismisses the idea of going due to financial constraints, the encouragement to go comes from Zee, not Sad James. Zee tells Cyrus ""You can keep being the sad sober guy in Indiana who talks about being a writer, or you can go be one."" Additionally, while Cyrus does mention having his ""mom's bounty"" money, he doesn't explicitly state he will use it to fund the trip. The decision to go seems more influenced by Zee's encouragement than financial considerations.

Cyrus initially dismisses the idea due to financial constraints, but after Zee's encouragement, he considers using his mother's ""bounty"" money to fund the trip.

The statement is accurate based on the context provided. The passage describes Cyrus and Zee doing yardwork for Jude while under the influence of fentanyl. At one point, Cyrus is using an axe to chop wood and accidentally injures his foot when the axe bounces off the rubber tire they were using and strikes his foot. The text states: ""The axe was lying on the grass by his left foot, but peering over I saw his blue canvas shoe was torn open, purpling."" This clearly indicates that Cyrus accidentally injured his foot with the axe while chopping wood at Jude's house.

The statement is mostly accurate but contains a few key errors. According to the context, Cyrus and Zee were chopping wood at Jude's house, but they were under the influence of fentanyl, not alcohol. The injury did occur accidentally with an axe while attempting to chop firewood, but it's described as Cyrus dropping the axe on his foot after it bounced off the rubber tire they were using, rather than a direct chopping injury. While the general scenario of Cyrus injuring his foot with an axe while intoxicated is correct, the specific details about the substance and exact mechanism of injury are inaccurate.

The statement is not entirely accurate based on the context provided. While Orkideh and Cyrus do meet at the Brooklyn Museum and discuss some aspects of Cyrus's background, including his Iranian heritage, the conversation is not framed as Orkideh questioning Cyrus about his motivations. Rather, Cyrus is the one who came to interview Orkideh for his book project on martyrdom. Orkideh does make some observations about Cyrus's interest in death, but it's not presented as her interrogating him. The tone of their interaction seems more conversational and mutually exploratory rather than Orkideh specifically questioning Cyrus. Therefore, while some elements of the statement are true, its overall characterization of their meeting is not fully supported by the given context.

At that point, Orkideh smiled toward the German couple and tilted her head to gesture for them to come sit. She then said to Cyrus, ""Come see me again tomorrow, if we're both still here.""

It also mentions that he bought a Coke from a halal meat cart outside the museum. However, the statement claims Cyrus reflects on his ideas about martyrdom and dying, which is not explicitly stated in the given context. While Cyrus does think about Orkideh's comments and his book project, the context does not specifically mention him reflecting on martyrdom and dying at this point.

He looked forward to that all week, going to the library and picking out a VHS, a DVD to borrow. We'd each choose one. He liked everything I liked. Mostly I liked Westerns.""

It goes on to say that Cyrus ""believed a hyper-focus on occasions for gratitude would make his eventual death more poignant, more valuable"" and that he considered ""lifting yourself out of a life you enjoyed"" to be ""real sacrifice"" and more meaningful.

While the dream does include some changes to the environment, such as snow beginning to fall and trees flowering, there is no mention of the scene becoming a desert or of goldfinches appearing. The dream setting remains primarily in the parking lot area, with some surreal changes occurring around it, but it does not transform into a completely different desert landscape.

The statement is true based on the context provided. In Cyrus's dream, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Beethoven Shams (Cyrus's imaginary younger brother) do have a conversation about Kareem's burned record collection. Kareem talks about how his home burned down and he lost thousands of irreplaceable jazz records. They discuss the significance of these physical records versus just the music itself. Beethoven's status as an imaginary character is also directly addressed when Kareem says ""Sometimes I forget you've never actually been alive."" The dream conversation covers both of these key elements mentioned in the statement.
</explanation>

<answer>TRUE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement contains some inaccuracies when compared to the dream sequence described in the context. In the dream, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Beethoven Shams (Cyrus's imaginary brother) do discuss a burned record collection, but it was Kareem's collection that burned, not Beethoven's. They talk about how Lakers fans sent Kareem replacement records after his home burned down. Additionally, while Beethoven is indeed an imaginary character (Cyrus's made-up brother), his status as such is not explicitly discussed in their conversation. The dream focuses more on their dialogue about records, jokes, and the nature of fandom rather than Beethoven's imaginary status.

The statement is true based on the context provided. In Cyrus's dream conversation between Beethoven Shams (his imaginary younger brother) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Beethoven does undergo a physical transformation. Specifically, the passage states that Beethoven's appearance changes: ""Beethoven looked at his hand, which was growing paler and paler by the second. It was like someone in Photoshop was slowly sliding the brightness filter up."" It also mentions his hair growing long and gray. Additionally, Kareem directly acknowledges Beethoven's status as an imaginary character, saying ""Sometimes I forget you've never actually been alive."" This confirms both key elements of the statement - the physical transformation and the discussion of Beethoven's imaginary nature.
</explanation>

<answer>TRUE</answer>","<explanation>
After carefully reviewing the context, I did not find any evidence of a scene matching the statement. The dream sequence described involves Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Beethoven (Cyrus's imaginary brother), not Rumi. There is no mention of Rumi undergoing a physical transformation or discussing his status as an imaginary character with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The dream focuses on a conversation between Kareem and Beethoven about what they love, jokes, and music. While Beethoven does undergo some changes, becoming older and paler, this does not match the description in the statement. Therefore, the statement appears to be false based on the information provided in the context.

The statement is supported by multiple details in the context. Arash describes wearing a ""long black robe like the hair of a god"" and using a ""DC flashlight mounted in the neck beneath the hood"" to illuminate his face while riding on horseback among dying soldiers. He also mentions carrying a sword that is ""meant to look like Zulfiqar, sword of Hazrat Ali"" with a blade that splits into two fangs at the end. The purpose of this role is described as appearing like an angel to dying soldiers on the battlefield to give them hope and prevent them from committing suicide. While some minor details may differ slightly, the key elements of the black robe, mounted light, special sword, and angelic appearance on horseback are all present in Arash's account.
</explanation>

<answer>TRUE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement is mostly accurate but contains one key error. According to the context, Arash did wear a black robe and use a mounted flashlight as part of his role riding among dying soldiers on the battlefield. However, the context does not mention Arash using a shield. Instead, it states that he carried a sword, specifically one meant to look like Zulfiqar, the sword of Hazrat Ali.

The statement appears to be true based on the context provided. While Arman explains the religious purpose of the ""angel"" riders to comfort dying soldiers and prevent them from committing suicide, Arash's own thoughts and feelings about the role seem more detached and less religiously motivated. He describes it matter-of-factly, noting he was likely chosen because he fit the cloak and could ride a horse, not due to religious devotion. Arash also mentions his own ""scattered belief"" in the prophets, saying he can sometimes see their shapes but ""never with any depth."" His focus seems to be more on performing the assigned duty than on its religious significance. The text suggests Arash carries out the role, but without strong personal religious conviction driving his actions.
</explanation>

<answer>TRUE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement is false based on the context provided. While Arman does explain the religious purpose of the ""angel"" riders to Arash, the passage does not indicate that Arash himself performs his duties with strong religious conviction. In fact, the text suggests the opposite - Arash expresses skepticism and uncertainty about religion, saying ""the prophets in whom I can only muster for myself scattered belief"" and that he can sometimes see their shapes but ""never with any depth."" Arash also states that what he does or doesn't believe doesn't matter, and that he rides for the dying men, not for himself or his country. This suggests he is going through the motions without strong personal religious conviction.

The statement contains several inaccuracies when compared to the context provided. While Cyrus did arrive early at the museum with coffee for Orkideh, he was unable to bring it into the gallery and had to discard it. Their conversation covered topics like grief, art, and Cyrus's personal experiences, but it took place on a different day than when Cyrus brought coffee. Additionally, on the day Cyrus arrived early with coffee, he found that Orkideh had passed away and the Death-Speak exhibit was closed. Therefore, the statement conflates events from different days and contains factual errors about their interaction.

Instead, Cyrus later met with Sang Linh, Orkideh's gallerist, in Prospect Park to discuss Orkideh's death and revelations about Cyrus's mother.

The statement appears to be FALSE based on the context provided. While Cyrus did have a conversation with Orkideh and promised to return the next day, there is no indication that he realized he never mentioned Flight 655 to her. In fact, the context suggests the opposite - Cyrus was surprised that Orkideh seemed to know about the flight without him mentioning it. The passage states: ""Cyrus was trying to remember if he'd ever mentioned to Orkideh how his mother had died. He sat on a park bench. He'd told her about Zee, about his father, about his mother dying; but, for the life of him, he couldn't remember ever saying anything about Flight 655."" This implies that Cyrus was puzzled by Orkideh's apparent knowledge of the flight, rather than realizing he had never mentioned it.

The statement is false based on the context provided. After his conversation with Orkideh, Cyrus leaves the museum feeling confused about how Orkideh knew about Flight 655, which he doesn't recall mentioning to her.

The middle school teacher who surreptitiously offered him a racial slur, like a juicy orange they might peel together and share. Even his name could pass as white. Cyrus Shams. Weird, probably ethnic, but kind of inscrutably so. Cyrus felt like Blade, the Wesley Snipes hero, half human, half vampire, with all the superpowers of each species, super strong but also capable of walking around in sunlight.""

He spends decades writing a great poem for the king, who initially refuses to pay him properly. After Ferdowsi's death, the king regrets his actions and sends gold coins to Ferdowsi's daughter. She uses the payment to construct ""The Poet's Bridge"" in honor of her father. The interlude concludes with this bridge being built and still standing today.

Instead, it states that Ferdowsi dies before receiving payment for his poem, and his daughter Tahmina uses the payment to construct the bridge.

First, while walking, it states ""Every day I would sit at the table in the morning before going to look for work and she would come over and say 'hell chai' and we would giggle."" Later, when confronted by a security guard, Leila claims to be a soldier, saying ""Baba, I am a soldier!"" and ""I am just here with my girl! Don't you love your soldiers?""

The second instance is when confronted by a security guard, where Leila does explicitly claim to be a soldier, saying ""I am a soldier!"" to avoid getting in trouble.

The passage describes Leila persuading Roya to climb a wall, which reveals a hidden view of giraffes in a zoo enclosure on the other side. It also mentions their confrontation with a security guard who tells them to get down. However, the statement contains one inaccuracy - it was not Leila who persuaded Roya to climb the wall, but rather Leila who climbed up first and then helped pull Roya up.

Not your parents when you were little, but as an adult. When was the last time someone saw you cry naked?"" This question does indeed initiate a conversation between them about vulnerability and intimacy. Leila goes on to share her own experiences with crying, describing it as a ""betrayal"" of her body.

The text states: ""Cyrus winced at every detail. He kept saying he was sorry. And he was. Zee said, 'I know,' again and again, but only once Cyrus truly believed him did he tell Zee the story of *his* day: going to see Orkideh that morning, fainting on the staircase, Prateek and his aunt, Sang's voicemail, then meeting her, what Sang told him about his mother, his mother and the plane crash and Leila and Orkideh's final letter in the paper, all of it, all of it whooshing out of him like steam.""

In the context provided, Cyrus and Zee do have an intimate moment in their hotel room after Cyrus's shower. However, there is no mention of them going outside to smoke together. Instead, their argument occurs later that evening in the hotel room itself, not upon returning from smoking.

Leila pulls Roya into a secluded alley off the main bazaar strip and surprises her with a kiss.,Leila pulls Roya into a busy street off the main bazaar strip and surprises her with a kiss.,True,True,"<explanation>
The statement is true according to the context provided. The passage describes Leila pulling Roya into an alley off the main bazaar corridor. It then states: ""And then she leaned forward and kissed me. Right there in the alley path off the bazaar."" The kiss is described as unexpected for Roya, who had her eyes open in surprise. The passage goes on to say that although Roya should have been afraid of being seen, she held the kiss and kissed Leila back. This matches the details given in the statement about Leila surprising Roya with a kiss in a secluded alley off the main bazaar.
</explanation>

<answer>TRUE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement is not entirely accurate based on the context provided. While Leila does indeed kiss Roya unexpectedly, it does not occur in a busy street off the main bazaar strip. The passage describes Leila pulling Roya into a ""bare alley that bent into another alley"" off the bazaar corridor. The alley is described as ""thin, dirty, ending in brick apartments and garbage cans"" - not a busy street. The kiss takes place in this more secluded alley setting, not in a busy street as the statement claims. Therefore, while the kiss itself did occur, the location described in the statement is incorrect.

"After wetting the bed in his Brooklyn hotel room, Cyrus cleans up, leaves money for the maid, and checks out of the hotel.","After wetting the bed in his Brooklyn apartment, Cyrus cleans up, leaves money for the maid, and checks out of the hotel.",True,True,"<explanation>
The statement is consistent with the details provided in the context. The passage describes Cyrus waking up to find he had wet the bed in his hotel room. It then states that he cleaned up, left $40 for the maid with an apologetic note, made coffee, gathered his belongings, and proceeded to check out of the hotel. The sequence of events and specific details (like leaving money for the maid) match what is claimed in the statement.
</explanation>

<answer>TRUE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement contains some inaccuracies when compared to the context provided. While Cyrus did wet the bed and leave money for the maid, this occurred in his hotel room, not in a Brooklyn apartment. The context states that Cyrus was staying at a hotel, not an apartment. Additionally, the context mentions that Cyrus left $40 for the maid, not an unspecified amount of money. The statement is correct that Cyrus checked out of the hotel after this incident. However, due to the inaccuracies regarding the location and the specificity of the money left, the statement cannot be considered entirely true.

The statement contains some true elements but also some inaccuracies when compared to the context provided. The context does mention Cyrus listening to Miserere on his way to the museum. However, it states that Cyrus had already been to the museum earlier that morning, and was now sitting on a bench in Prospect Park across from the museum. The context does not describe Cyrus walking to or entering the museum again, nor does it mention him paying an admission fee on this visit. Therefore, while some details are accurate, the overall statement is not fully supported by the given context.
</explanation>

<answer>FALSE</answer>","<explanation>
The context does mention that Cyrus walks to the Brooklyn Museum while listening to Miserere on his headphones. However, it does not state that he makes a donation upon arrival. In fact, the context indicates that when Cyrus arrives at the museum, he finds that the Death-Speak exhibit is closed and Orkideh has passed away. There is no mention of Cyrus making a donation. The statement combines one true element (Cyrus walking to the museum while listening to Miserere) with an unverified claim about making a donation, which is not supported by the given context.

The statement accurately captures several key elements of the dream sequence described in the context. Ali and Rumi are indeed depicted sitting on the steps of a music venue, smoking and conversing. They discuss topics related to the afterlife, with Rumi sharing insights about the nature of dreams and reality. Ali also shares a personal experience about his son Cyrus. However, the statement is not entirely precise, as their conversation covers additional topics beyond just ""the nature of the afterlife and sharing personal experiences."" They also discuss irony in dreams, the transformation of the surrounding environment, and Cyrus's readiness for what comes next. Despite these minor omissions, the core elements of the statement are supported by the text.
</explanation>

<answer>TRUE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement is mostly accurate but contains some inaccuracies. In the dream sequence, Ali and Rumi do converse on steps outside a music venue, not a park bench. They do smoke - Ali has a cigarette and Rumi has a blunt. They discuss aspects of the afterlife, with Rumi explaining how things work ""here"" (presumably the afterlife) and sharing his experiences. Ali also shares a personal experience about his wife possibly cheating. However, they are not in a park as stated. Given that the core elements of the conversation and smoking are correct, but the setting is inaccurately described as a park bench, I cannot say the statement is entirely true.

The statement is false based on several key details in the context. While Ali does confide in Rumi about his suspicions of his wife's potential infidelity, there is no indication that Rumi is preparing to perform at the music venue or that he invites Ali inside. In fact, the context describes Ali and Rumi sitting outside on steps, talking. The music and sounds described seem to be coming from inside the venue, but neither Ali nor Rumi are portrayed as preparing to go in or perform. The conversation ends with Zee (who has replaced Rumi in the dialogue) asking Cyrus if he feels ready, implying they are preparing for something else entirely, not a musical performance.

<answer>FALSE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement contains some true elements but also significant inaccuracies when compared to the context provided. While Rumi and Ali do have a conversation outside a music venue where Rumi is preparing to perform, their discussion does not match what is described in the statement. Ali does confide in Rumi about suspecting his wife's infidelity before her death, but this happens during their conversation outside, not after Rumi invites Ali inside.

The statement is largely accurate but contains a few minor inaccuracies. The passage does describe Rumi performing inside a venue and captivating the audience, including Ali and Zee. It also mentions Rumi's head catching fire and the venue's ceiling opening to reveal the night sky. However, the statement says this captivates Ali and Zee, when the text only explicitly mentions Ali being present, not Zee. Additionally, the fire is described as Rumi's ""whole head like the burning faces of the prophets in old paintings, just one great flame"" rather than simply ""catching fire."" Despite these small discrepancies, the core events described in the statement do occur in the passage.

The statement is true based on the context provided. The passage describes how Roya and Leila's relationship progresses from a kiss in an alley off Bazaar-e Tajrish to a more intimate moment in Roya's home. Specifically, after the kiss in the alley, the narrative jumps to a scene where Leila is at Roya's house, putting on a Rolling Stones record. They then dance together to the song, with Roya describing it as a deeply emotional and intimate moment. This progression matches the sequence of events described in the statement.

Specifically, it mentions Leila putting on a Rolling Stones record and the two women dancing closely together to the song ""I Want You Back."" The passage also strongly implies that Roya and Leila engage in intimate activities beyond just dancing, as it describes them kissing and Roya feeling that ""there was no separation between us, Leila and me, between our bodies."" So while the husbands are away camping and likely drinking, Roya and Leila do indeed engage in intimate activities at Roya's home, including dancing to a Rolling Stones song.

The statement contains some inaccuracies when compared to the context provided. While it's true that Roya and Leila engage in intimate activities while their husbands are away on a camping trip, several details are incorrect. The context does not mention a hotel - their activities take place in Roya's house. They do dance to a Rolling Stones song, but this occurs in Roya's home, not a hotel. Additionally, while the husbands are on a camping trip, the context does not explicitly state they are drunk, only that they drink and smoke cigars.

The statement contains both true and false elements. It is true that Cyrus searches for pictures of Orkideh online to find resemblances to himself and Roya. The passage states: ""Cyrus clicked one open with his thumb—an older picture, Orkideh looked maybe forty. [...] He studied her eyes. They were deep black but flashed with a brightness, like they held tiny fish that turned to catch the light on their scales. An incitement. Cyrus looked for the Roya of his father's wedding photo in her face. Then he looked for himself."" However, the statement is false in claiming that Sang offers to drive to Cyrus's location in Prospect Park. The passage indicates that Sang was already with Cyrus in the park when they had their conversation, and there is no mention of her offering to drive there to meet him.

The statement contains several inaccuracies when compared to the context provided. Firstly, Cyrus is not searching for pictures of Orkideh online at this point - he had already done so earlier. Secondly, Sang does not offer to drive to meet Cyrus; rather, she is already meeting with him in person at Prospect Park, not Central Park.

Just before this, the text mentions ""The ground was breathing"" and other unnatural phenomena. Given this dreamlike, hallucinatory context, and the fact that Zee says ""You'll forgive the universe its moment of high drama"" right after, it seems this event is meant to be understood as actually occurring within the surreal reality of the story's ending, rather than being metaphorical or imagined.

The passage states that ""The golden light cracking through the ground had gathered into a vast and deep pool, warm and gurgling absently like an unattended infant."" It then describes Cyrus kneeling over this pool with Zee beside him, wiping away his tears. The text suggests they are preparing for some kind of transition or next step, with Zee asking if Cyrus feels ready and Cyrus reaching his hand into the pool. While the exact nature of what comes next is unclear, the details align with the statement about them kneeling by a golden pool and preparing for an unknown next step.

<answer>TRUE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement is close to accurate, but contains some key inaccuracies. In the final scene, Cyrus and Zee do kneel by a pool that has formed in the ground, but it is described as a ""vast and deep pool"" with ""golden light"", not a silver pool. The text states ""Together, Cyrus and Zee stood up. The golden light cracking through the ground had gathered into a vast and deep pool, warm and gurgling absently like an unattended infant. Cyrus knelt over the swirl and gasped a little."" While they do seem to be preparing for some kind of transition or next step, with Zee asking if Cyrus feels ready, the exact nature of what comes next is left ambiguous. Given these discrepancies, particularly the color of the pool being golden rather than silver, the statement cannot be considered fully true.

Smith.",True,True,"<explanation>
The statement appears to be true based on the context provided. The passage describes Sang, Roya, and Duy taking down an exhibition called ""Why We Put Mirrors in Birdcages"" at Sang's gallery. It specifically mentions Duy carrying a large painting titled ""Odi et Amo"" and Sang directing him to place it with other works being sent to David J. T. Swartzwelder, who is described as ""a health-care tycoon who'd purchased a third of the show himself."" The details in the statement align with what is described in the passage, including the exhibition name, Duy carrying the painting, and the buyer's name.
</explanation>

<answer>TRUE</answer>","<explanation>
The statement contains several inaccuracies when compared to the context provided. First, the buyer's name is given as David J. T. Swartzwelder in the passage, not Johnathan P. Smith. Second, Swartzwelder is described as a ""health-care tycoon,"" not just a generic buyer. Additionally, while Duy does carry the ""Odi et Amo"" painting, he is instructed to place it on a pallet with other works going to Swartzwelder, not to pack it individually. The passage also indicates this is occurring during the takedown of the exhibition, not a dismantling. These discrepancies make the statement false.
