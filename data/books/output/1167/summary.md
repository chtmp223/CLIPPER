A young detective named Q recounts a mysterious case he encountered, which involved the sudden disappearance of a girl named Emily from the household of Mr. Blake, a wealthy bachelor living in New York City. The case begins when a concerned housekeeper, Mrs. Daniels, visits the detective precinct to report that Emily, a sewing girl living in Mr. Blake's home, has vanished under suspicious circumstances.

Q and his superior, Mr. Gryce, investigate the room from which Emily disappeared and discover signs of a struggle, including a torn curtain and an open window leading to the roof of an extension. Drops of blood are found on the window sill, suggesting foul play. Mrs. Daniels insists that Emily would never have left voluntarily, and expresses a deep, almost personal concern for the girl's safety, hinting at a secret she cannot reveal.

As the investigation unfolds, Q learns more about Mr. Blake, a reclusive and enigmatic figure who avoids social gatherings and seems uninterested in his servants. Despite his aloofness, Mr. Blake becomes involved when he learns of Emily's disappearance, though he claims to know little about her.

Q's investigation leads him to shadow Mr. Blake, who exhibits unusual behavior by frequenting the lower parts of the city, seemingly searching for someone. This behavior raises suspicions about his involvement in Emily's disappearance. Meanwhile, Q discovers a connection between Mr. Blake and a notorious pair of criminals, the Schoenmakers, who have recently escaped from prison.

The case takes a turn when a body matching Emily's description is found in the East River, but the discovery of golden hair on the body contradicts the description given by Fanny, a housemaid, who claimed Emily had black hair. This discrepancy leads Q to question the reliability of Fanny's account and the true identity of the missing girl.

As the investigation deepens, it is revealed that Emily is actually Luttra Blake, Mr. Blake's estranged wife. She had been living in disguise in his house, unknown to him, to protect him from the criminal activities of her father and brother, the Schoenmakers. Luttra had left the house under duress to prevent harm from coming to Mr. Blake, demonstrating her love and devotion despite their estrangement.

The case concludes with the capture of the Schoenmakers, facilitated by Q's discovery of their hideout. Mr. Blake, now aware of Luttra's true identity and her sacrifices, seeks to reconcile with her. However, Luttra, burdened by the shame of her family's crimes, initially refuses to return to him. It is only after the revelation of Mr. Blake's father's will, which leaves his fortune to Luttra, that she agrees to reunite with her husband, not for the money, but because of their mutual love and understanding. The story ends with their reconciliation, as Luttra takes her rightful place beside Mr. Blake, ready to face the future together.
