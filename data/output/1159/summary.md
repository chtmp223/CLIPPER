Paul Harley, a renowned investigator, finds himself embroiled in a mysterious case following the sudden death of Sir Charles Abingdon. Sir Charles had approached Harley with concerns about his safety, hinting at a danger associated with the term "Fire-Tongue" and a man named Nicol Brinn. Shortly after, Sir Charles dies under suspicious circumstances, uttering the words "Fire-Tongue" and "Nicol Brinn" before his death. Harley is convinced that Sir Charles was murdered and begins to unravel the mystery surrounding these cryptic words.

Nicol Brinn, an enigmatic American millionaire with a reputation for eccentricity and a penchant for danger, is implicated in the mystery. Despite his apparent fear and knowledge of "Fire-Tongue," Brinn is tight-lipped, refusing to divulge what he knows, which adds to Harley's suspicion that a powerful and dangerous secret organization is at play. Brinn's reluctance to speak is driven by fear of retribution from this organization, which he has encountered before in India.

Phil Abingdon, Sir Charles's daughter, becomes a central figure in Harley's investigation. She is a vibrant and strong-willed woman who is also being courted by Ormuz Khan, a wealthy and mysterious Persian with connections to international finance. Harley is wary of Ormuz Khan and suspects his involvement in the sinister events surrounding Sir Charles's death.

As Harley delves deeper into the case, he discovers that Sir Charles had been under surveillance and had received a bogus message that led him away from his home shortly before his death. Harley's investigation reveals that Sir Charles had been researching "Fire-Tongue," a secretive cult with roots in India, and had come across dangerous information that led to his murder.

The investigation takes Harley into the shadowy world of international intrigue, where he learns of a secret temple and the cult's influence stretching from the East to the West. Nicol Brinn, who has been haunted by his own encounter with the cult, eventually reveals that he had been branded with the mark of "Fire-Tongue" during his travels in India, a mark that signifies membership or association with the cult.

The story unfolds with Harley's relentless pursuit of the truth, his protective instincts towards Phil Abingdon, and his determination to uncover the identity of "Fire-Tongue" and the extent of the cult's reach. As he navigates through a web of deceit, danger, and hidden motives, Harley must confront the powerful forces at play and ensure the safety of those involved, all while unraveling the mystery that led to Sir Charles Abingdon's untimely death.
