The story unfolds around a group of children living in rural Prince Edward Island, Canada, who experience a summer filled with adventures, friendships, and life lessons. The main characters include the narrator, Beverley King, his brother Felix, their cousins Felicity, Cecily, and Dan, the imaginative and captivating Sara Stanley (known as the Story Girl), and their friend Peter Craig, a hired boy with a mysterious past.

The children are sent to live with their relatives, Uncle Alec and Aunt Janet King, while their father is away on business in Rio de Janeiro. They quickly become part of the family and community, forming close bonds with each other and other local children, including Sara Ray, a timid girl from a strict household.

The Story Girl, with her enchanting storytelling ability, becomes the heart of the group, weaving tales from local legends, family history, and her vivid imagination. Her stories often reflect the children's experiences and emotions, providing both entertainment and moral lessons.

One of the central plotlines involves the children collecting money for a school library fund, showcasing their determination and creativity. They engage in various schemes to earn money, from selling eggs and baking to fishing and performing chores. Their efforts highlight themes of friendship, cooperation, and the innocence of childhood.

Throughout the summer, the children face various challenges and adventures. They encounter local folklore, such as the mysterious Awkward Man and the supposed witch Peg Bowen. They also deal with personal fears and conflicts, such as Peter's struggle with his religious identity and the group's collective fear of the Judgment Day, which they believe is imminent due to a newspaper article.

The children also explore family secrets, such as the contents of the old blue chest belonging to their deceased relative, Rachel Ward. The chest contains items from Rachel's past, including a wedding dress and letters, which reveal a story of love and heartbreak.

As the summer progresses, the children learn valuable life lessons about kindness, forgiveness, and the importance of family and community. They grow closer, forming bonds that will last a lifetime.
