- Chapter 11, item 4: Major Connel orders Tom, Astro, and Alfie to explore Tara's surface using a jet boat, without landing.
- Relationship: Mission progression",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""The Polaris unit, initially assigned to test a new audio transmitter on Tara"": This part is grounded in the book summary, which states that the Polaris unit is assigned to test a new audio communications transmitter on Tara under Major Connel's command. It is also supported by event 3 in Chapter 2, where the Polaris unit receives orders for this mission.
    b. ""explores the planet's surface using a jet boat without landing"": This part is grounded in event 5 of Chapter 11, where Tom, Astro, and Alfie explore Tara's surface using a jet boat without landing.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The claim connects the initial assignment of the Polaris unit to test the transmitter with their subsequent exploration of Tara's surface, which is a logical progression of their mission activities.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation or assumption; it is explicitly supported by the chapter outline and the book summary.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the exploration of Tara's surface is a part of their mission activities.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""The Polaris unit, initially assigned to test a new audio transmitter on Tara"": This part is grounded in the book summary, which states that the Polaris unit is assigned to test a new audio communications transmitter on Tara under Major Connel's command. It is also supported by Chapter 2, where Strong briefs the cadets on their mission to Tara.
    b. ""explores the planet's surface by landing their spaceship"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. In Chapter 11, the Polaris successfully lands on Tara, but Major Connel orders the cadets to explore Tara's surface using a jet boat without landing. Therefore, the exploration is done via a jet boat, not by landing the spaceship on the surface.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not valid because the claim incorrectly states that the exploration of Tara's surface is done by landing the spaceship, which contradicts the chapter outline where the exploration is conducted using a jet boat.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation but is factually incorrect based on the chapter outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it misrepresents the method of exploration.

Since part 1b. is not grounded in the chapter outline and the relationship between the atomic parts is not valid, the claim is INVALID."
