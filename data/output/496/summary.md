In a kingdom called Nomansland, a beautiful prince named Dolor is born to the King and Queen after a long wait. However, tragedy strikes when the Queen, Dolorez, dies shortly after the prince's christening. The King, heartbroken, dies soon after, leaving the young prince as the heir to the throne. The King's brother, who had been the heir presumptive, becomes the regent until Prince Dolor comes of age. Unbeknownst to the people, the regent has sinister plans to keep the throne for himself.

Prince Dolor, who is crippled and unable to walk, is secretly taken to a remote tower by a condemned woman and a deaf-mute, where he is to live out his days in isolation. The tower is equipped with everything he needs, but he is cut off from the world. As he grows, he becomes aware of his limitations and the loneliness of his life. His only companion is a lark, a gift from his godmother, a mysterious old woman who visits him and gives him a magical traveling-cloak.

With this cloak, Prince Dolor can explore the world beyond his tower. He learns about his kingdom, sees the beauty and the harsh realities of life, and dreams of being more than a prisoner in his own life. His godmother encourages him to use the cloak to learn and grow, but she also warns him that he must make his own choices.

One day, the regent dies, and the kingdom is thrown into chaos. The people, weary of the regent's rule, remember the rightful heir, Prince Dolor. A revolution ensues, and the people demand their true king. The condemned woman, feeling remorse for her part in Dolor's exile, spreads the word that the prince is alive. She and the deaf-mute return to the tower to bring him back to the capital.

Prince Dolor, now a young man, is crowned king. He is determined to rule justly and wisely, despite his physical limitations. He moves to the palace, where he finds a room that looks out on the Beautiful Mountains, a place where he can always find his godmother and talk to her about his mother, the late Queen Dolorez.

As King, Dolor learns to navigate his duties, drawing strength from his godmother's teachings and the love of his people. He becomes a beloved ruler, known for his wisdom and kindness, proving that true strength comes from within. His journey from isolation to the throne teaches him, and the reader, that one's limitations do not define one's potential, and that love and courage can overcome any obstacle.
