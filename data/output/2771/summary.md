As Richard Paramor Shelton travels from Dover to London, he encounters a diverse group of passengers in a third-class carriage, including a young foreign girl and a cynical youth named Louis Ferrand. The girl, who is without a ticket, seeks help, and Shelton, moved by her plight, lends her money. This incident sets the tone for Shelton's journey through a society that is both familiar and alien to him.

Shelton, recently engaged to Antonia Dennant, is caught between his love for her and his growing awareness of society's hypocrisies. Antonia, from a well-bred family, embodies the ideals of her class: propriety, duty, and a certain aloofness from the harsher realities of life. As Shelton navigates his engagement, he becomes increasingly aware of the chasm between his own ideals and those of the world around him.

Throughout his journey, Shelton is haunted by encounters with people who challenge his perceptions. Ferrand, a vagabond with a sharp intellect and a disdain for societal norms, becomes a recurring figure in Shelton's life. Ferrand's presence forces Shelton to confront the superficiality and complacency of his own social circle, which includes characters like the Dennants and their guests, who are more concerned with appearances and propriety than with genuine human connection.

As Shelton spends time at Holm Oaks, the Dennant family estate, he observes the genteel life of the upper classes, filled with tennis matches, dinner parties, and polite conversation. Yet, beneath the surface, he senses a lack of authenticity and a reluctance to engage with the deeper issues of life. Antonia, though intelligent and spirited, is bound by the expectations of her upbringing, and Shelton struggles to reconcile his love for her with his growing disillusionment.

A turning point comes when Shelton encounters Mrs. Foliot, a woman ostracized by society due to her scandalous relationship. The incident, combined with Ferrand's departure and the superficiality of a wedding he attends, deepens Shelton's internal conflict. He begins to question the very foundations of his life and the society he is part of, realizing that his engagement to Antonia might be more about fulfilling societal expectations than true companionship.

Shelton's journey is marked by moments of introspection and encounters with a variety of characters who symbolize different aspects of society. From the pragmatic and detached Mr. Paramor, his uncle, to the lively but shallow guests at the Casserols' dinner, each interaction reveals the complexities and contradictions of the world Shelton inhabits.

Ultimately, Shelton is faced with a choice: to conform to the expectations of his class and marry Antonia, or to break free and seek a life that aligns with his deeper values. The novel ends with Shelton writing a letter to Antonia, releasing her from their engagement and acknowledging the need for both of them to find their own paths.

Through Shelton's eyes, the novel explores themes of love, duty, social class, and the search for authenticity in a world that often values appearances over substance. His journey is one of self-discovery, as he grapples with the tension between societal expectations and personal integrity.
