In June, the sculptor Kenyon arrives at an ancient country house in Tuscany, resembling a castle, to visit his friend Donatello, the young Count of Monte Beni. The setting is picturesque, with the villa overlooking a spacious valley framed by the Apennines. Kenyon has left Rome, which becomes inhospitable in the summer, seeking inspiration in the Tuscan hills. As he approaches the villa, he is welcomed by Donatello, who seems changed from the carefree youth Kenyon once knew in Rome. Donatello's demeanor is now marked by gravity and introspection.

The villa, with its gray tower and modern extensions, serves as a backdrop for Kenyon's visit. Donatello, who once embodied the spirit of a Faun, now bears the weight of a mysterious sorrow. Kenyon notices that Donatello's household is small, consisting only of a few elderly servants, Tomaso and Stella, and a cook, Girolamo. Despite the villa's grandeur, it feels empty and melancholic.

As Kenyon and Donatello converse, it becomes apparent that Donatello is struggling with a profound inner turmoil. He is haunted by a sense of guilt and remorse, which has transformed his once joyous nature. Kenyon, aware of Donatello's past, tries to understand the depth of his friend's anguish. The narrative reveals that Donatello's life has been irrevocably altered by a crime he committed, which has awakened his conscience and led to a painful self-awareness.

Meanwhile, Hilda, a young artist and mutual friend, has been living in Rome, maintaining a solitary existence. She is burdened by a secret involving a crime she witnessed, which has isolated her from her friends. Hilda's deep sense of morality and her struggle with the knowledge of the crime create a shadow over her life. The narrative explores her internal conflict and the impact of the secret on her relationships, particularly with Kenyon, who harbors feelings for her.

As the story unfolds, Kenyon becomes involved in a quest to understand the mystery surrounding Hilda's disappearance and Donatello's transformation. He learns that Hilda has been taken to a religious establishment, possibly for her protection, but the circumstances are shrouded in secrecy. Kenyon's efforts to uncover the truth are intertwined with his own emotional journey, as he grapples with his feelings for Hilda and his role in the unfolding drama.

Throughout the narrative, the themes of guilt, redemption, and the struggle for moral clarity are explored. Donatello's character embodies the conflict between his innate innocence and the burden of his actions, while Hilda represents the moral compass that guides the characters through their trials. Kenyon, as an observer and participant, seeks to reconcile the complexities of human nature and the consequences of sin.

The story culminates in a resolution where the characters confront their past actions and seek a path towards redemption. Donatello and Hilda's fates are intertwined, and their journey reflects the broader themes of forgiveness and the possibility of spiritual renewal. As Kenyon prepares to leave Monte Beni, he reflects on the changes in his friends and the impact of their shared experiences, hopeful for a future where they can find peace and happiness.
