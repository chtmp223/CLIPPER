2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not explicitly stated in the chapter outline. While both parts involve blue chalk, the claim that the chalk found on Victoire matches the chalk used for Lupin's signatures is an assumption not directly supported by the provided information.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation, as the outline does not confirm that the chalk on Victoire is the same as that used for the signatures.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not valid because the claim incorrectly states the color of the chalk found on Victoire as red, whereas the outline specifies it as blue.
