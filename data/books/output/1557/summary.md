The story follows the life of Myles Falworth, a young boy who grows up in a turbulent medieval world where honor, chivalry, and political intrigue define one's fate. Myles is the son of Lord Falworth, a nobleman who has been unjustly outlawed and blinded due to the machinations of a powerful enemy, the Earl of Alban. As a child, Myles witnesses a brutal event that shapes his future, when Sir John Dale, a friend of his father, is murdered by the Earl of Alban.

Myles grows up in the secluded Crosbey-Dale, where he is trained in the arts of combat by Diccon Bowman, his father’s loyal retainer. His education is supplemented by studies in Latin and French, preparing him for a future that his parents hope will restore their family’s honor. When he turns sixteen, Myles is sent to the Earl of Mackworth’s castle to seek service and begin his journey towards knighthood, a path that could potentially restore his family's status.

At the castle, Myles faces the challenges of fitting into a new society governed by strict hierarchies and the rough camaraderie of the squires. He quickly becomes known for his boldness and courage, standing up against the oppressive bachelors who enforce a system of servitude among the younger squires. His defiance earns him both friends and enemies, but it also catches the eye of Sir James Lee, the stern and experienced knight in charge of the squires' training.

Myles’s life changes dramatically when he is knighted by King Henry IV, an honor orchestrated by the Earl of Mackworth, who has his own political motives. Myles is chosen to fight the renowned French knight, the Sieur de la Montaigne, in a joust. Despite his youth and inexperience, Myles defeats the seasoned knight, proving his worth and valor.

As Myles grows into manhood, he learns of the intricate political plots surrounding his family’s downfall. The Earl of Mackworth reveals to Myles that his father’s enemy is the powerful Earl of Alban, who has been seeking to destroy the Falworth family. Myles is tasked with the daunting challenge of restoring his family’s honor by eventually confronting and defeating the Earl of Alban.

Myles’s journey is not just one of physical prowess but also of moral and ethical growth. He grapples with the concepts of justice, loyalty, and the responsibilities of knighthood. His friendship with Francis Gascoyne, a fellow squire, provides him with unwavering support and camaraderie. Myles also develops a romantic interest in Lady Alice, the Earl’s niece, whom he serves as a true knight, hoping to win her love and favor.

The climax of the story arrives when Myles is called to challenge the Earl of Alban in a trial by combat, a fight that will determine his father’s fate and the future of the Falworth family. The duel is intense and brutal, with Myles fighting not only for his family’s honor but also for his own survival. Against all odds, Myles emerges victorious, proving his father’s innocence and securing the restoration of his family’s status.

In the end, Myles’s bravery and determination earn him the respect and admiration of those around him, including the King. He marries Lady Alice and takes his place as a rightful noble, having fulfilled his destiny to restore his family’s honor and forge his own path as a knight of great renown. The story concludes with Myles reflecting on his journey, grateful for the friendships and experiences that have shaped him into the man he has become.
