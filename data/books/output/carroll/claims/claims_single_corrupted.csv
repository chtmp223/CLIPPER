2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. Alice's curiosity about the White Rabbit directly leads to her decision to follow it, which is a logical and causal connection.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.

   b. ""causes her to run away and accidentally fall down a rabbit hole"": The chapter outline and book summary indicate that Alice follows the White Rabbit out of curiosity, not fear, and this leads her to fall down the rabbit hole. There is no mention of her running away due to fear.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the claim incorrectly attributes Alice's actions to fear, which is not supported by the provided information.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
