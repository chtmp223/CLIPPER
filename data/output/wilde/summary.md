In the opulent world of Victorian London, a young man named Dorian Gray becomes the subject of a portrait by the talented artist Basil Hallward. Basil is captivated by Dorian's extraordinary beauty and believes that his art has reached new heights because of him. During a visit to Basil's studio, Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, a charismatic and hedonistic aristocrat who espouses a philosophy of indulgence and the pursuit of beauty and pleasure above all else. Lord Henry's influence profoundly affects Dorian, awakening in him a desire to preserve his youth and beauty at any cost.

While admiring his completed portrait, Dorian makes a fateful wish: that the painting would age and bear the marks of his sins, while he remains forever young and unblemished. Unbeknownst to him, this wish is granted, setting the stage for a life of moral decay hidden behind a fa√ßade of eternal youth.

Dorian falls in love with a beautiful young actress named Sibyl Vane, whose talent captivates him. However, when she performs poorly due to her overwhelming love for him, Dorian cruelly ends their relationship, leading to Sibyl's tragic suicide. This event marks the first noticeable change in the portrait, which now bears a cruel expression. Horrified yet intrigued, Dorian hides the painting, realizing it reflects the corruption of his soul.

As years pass, Dorian indulges in a life of excess and debauchery, influenced by a yellow book given to him by Lord Henry, which becomes his guide to a hedonistic lifestyle. Despite his youthful appearance, rumors of his immoral actions begin to circulate in society. Friends and acquaintances suffer ruin or death, yet Dorian remains untouched by time, his portrait growing ever more grotesque.

Basil confronts Dorian about the rumors, and in a moment of rage, Dorian reveals the hideous portrait to him. In a fit of panic and anger, Dorian murders Basil, further sealing his descent into darkness. Seeking to dispose of the body, Dorian coerces an old friend, Alan Campbell, into using his scientific knowledge to destroy it, driving Campbell to suicide.

Haunted by his actions, Dorian attempts to find redemption by sparing a young village girl he had intended to seduce. However, this act of mercy fails to alter the portrait, which now mocks his superficial attempt at goodness. Dorian's paranoia grows when he encounters James Vane, Sibyl's brother, who seeks revenge for his sister's death. Although Dorian narrowly escapes, James is later accidentally killed during a hunting party.

Desperate to escape his torment, Dorian decides to destroy the portrait, believing it to be the source of his misery. In a final act of desperation, he stabs the painting, inadvertently killing himself. When his servants find him, they discover a withered, hideous old man on the floor, unrecognizable except for the rings on his fingers, while the portrait has reverted to its original state of youthful beauty.

"The Picture of Dorian Gray" explores themes of aestheticism, moral corruption, and the duality of human nature, ultimately illustrating the destructive power of vanity and the futile quest for eternal youth.
