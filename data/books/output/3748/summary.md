The story follows Professor Otto Liedenbrock, his nephew Axel, and their Icelandic guide Hans as they embark on a daring expedition to the center of the Earth. The adventure begins when Professor Liedenbrock discovers an ancient manuscript written by the Icelandic alchemist Arne Saknussemm. The manuscript, written in runic script, reveals a secret passage to the Earth's core through the crater of the Icelandic volcano Sn√¶fell.

Despite Axel's initial reluctance and fears about the journey's dangers, the trio sets off for Iceland. They are warmly received by the locals, and with the help of their guide Hans, they prepare for the perilous descent. The journey down the crater is fraught with challenges, including navigating through dark tunnels, overcoming physical exhaustion, and dealing with limited provisions.

As they venture deeper, the explorers encounter a variety of geological formations, from lava tunnels to vast underground seas. They also face the constant threat of volcanic activity and the risk of being trapped underground. Along the way, they find evidence of Saknussemm's journey, which bolsters their determination to reach the Earth's center.

The expedition takes a dramatic turn when they are caught in a violent storm on an underground sea, leading to a series of explosive events that propel them upward through a volcanic shaft. They are eventually expelled from the Earth through the crater of the active volcano Stromboli, located in Italy's Aeolian Islands.

Upon their return to the surface, the explorers are astonished to find themselves in the Mediterranean rather than Iceland. Their journey, filled with scientific discoveries and personal growth, culminates in a triumphant return to Hamburg, where Professor Liedenbrock gains fame and recognition for his groundbreaking expedition.

The story concludes with the revelation that the unusual behavior of their compass, which had misled them during their journey, was due to an electrical storm that reversed its poles. This discovery resolves the mystery of their unexpected route and adds a final touch of scientific curiosity to their incredible adventure.
