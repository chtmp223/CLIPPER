   b. ""leads to her discovering him with her snake Peter"": This part is grounded in events 5 and 6 of Chapter 7, where Archie opens the bag containing the snake, and the woman from the elevator, identified as Mme. Brudowska, sees him with the snake.
   c. ""resulting in a search of Archie's room by Mme. Brudowska and the hotel detective"": This part is grounded in event 1 of Chapter 8, where Mme. Brudowska and the hotel detective come to search Archie's room.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The sequence of events shows that the encounter in the elevator directly leads to Mme. Brudowska discovering Archie with the snake, which in turn results in the search of his room.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly supported by the sequence of events in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it follows a logical progression of events without any contradictions.
