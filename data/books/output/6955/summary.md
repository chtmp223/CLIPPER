The story unfolds with John Maude, a young American man, living a seemingly ordinary life in Jersey City, unaware of his royal heritage. His life takes a dramatic turn when he is informed by Mr. Crump, the secretary of a wealthy financier named Benjamin Scobell, that he is the rightful Prince of Mervo, a small Mediterranean island. Scobell, who owns the island's casino, orchestrates John's ascension to the throne, hoping to use him as a figurehead to attract tourists and boost the casino's profits.

John, initially bemused by his new role, arrives in Mervo and is greeted with a mix of pageantry and comic disorganization. As he settles into his position, he becomes increasingly disillusioned with the superficiality and lack of real power his title affords him. His primary duty is to act as a charming host and draw attention to the island, while the real control lies with Scobell and his casino operations.

The plot thickens when John encounters Betty Silver, a woman he had met briefly in America and who has now arrived in Mervo. Unbeknownst to John, Betty is Scobell's stepdaughter, summoned to the island with the intention of marrying John to create a royal romance that would further boost the casino's allure. Betty, however, is unaware of this scheme and is shocked to discover John's role in Scobell's plans.

As John and Betty's paths cross, they develop a connection, but misunderstandings arise. Betty, disillusioned by what she perceives as John's complicity in Scobell's commercial exploitation, is heartbroken and decides to leave Mervo. John, realizing the depth of his feelings for Betty, is determined to prove his integrity and win her trust.

In a moment of clarity, John decides to take a stand against Scobell's manipulative schemes. He announces the closure of the casino, a move that incites unrest among the island's inhabitants who have grown dependent on the casino's income. Scobell, furious at the disruption of his plans, warns John of the potential backlash from the populace.

Despite the risk, John remains steadfast in his decision, prioritizing his principles over the trappings of royalty. The islanders, initially resistant, eventually rally to support John's vision, leading to a peaceful revolution that restores the republic and ends the casino's dominance.

With the casino closed and his role as prince dissolved, John prepares to leave Mervo. However, his actions have not gone unnoticed by Betty, who sees the sincerity and courage behind his decisions. The story concludes with John and Betty reconciling, their relationship strengthened by the trials they have faced. John, having found his true self and purpose, leaves Mervo with Betty, ready to embrace a new life together, free from the constraints of royal obligation.
