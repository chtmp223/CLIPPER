In the Seeonee hills, Father Wolf and Mother Wolf are awakened by Tabaqui, the jackal, who brings news of Shere Khan, the tiger, hunting in their area. Shere Khan, known for his lameness and cattle-killing, is despised by the wolves. The wolves hear the tiger's frustrated roar as he misses his preyâ€”an infant boy. The baby, Mowgli, is found by Father Wolf, who brings him to the den. Despite Shere Khan's demands, the wolves refuse to surrender Mowgli. Mother Wolf, named Raksha, declares the boy will stay with them and one day hunt Shere Khan.

Mowgli grows up with the wolf pack, learning the ways of the jungle from Baloo, the bear, and Bagheera, the panther. He learns the Law of the Jungle, vital for his survival. The wolf pack's leader, Akela, is aging, and Shere Khan plots to take over, influencing the younger wolves. Bagheera warns Mowgli of the danger and advises him to get the Red Flower (fire) from the human village for protection. Mowgli retrieves the fire and uses it to intimidate the wolves and Shere Khan during a council meeting, asserting his place in the jungle. He vows to return and hunt Shere Khan.

Years pass, and Mowgli continues to live in the jungle, but he is eventually cast out by the wolf pack under Shere Khan's influence. He returns to the human village, where he is taken in by Messua, who believes he is her long-lost son. Mowgli struggles to adapt to human ways but learns their language and customs. He discovers Shere Khan's plan to kill him and devises a strategy to trap the tiger. With the help of his wolf brothers, he leads the village's buffalo herd to trample Shere Khan, fulfilling his vow.

Elsewhere, on the island of Novastoshnah, Kotick, a rare white seal, witnesses the slaughter of seals by humans. Determined to find a safe haven, he searches the seas for an island where seals can live without fear. After many adventures and near-death experiences, he discovers a hidden island and leads his fellow seals there, ensuring their safety.

In the bungalow of Segowlee cantonment, Rikki-tikki-tavi, a brave mongoose, is taken in by a British family after being washed out of his burrow. He becomes the protector of the household, particularly against Nag and Nagaina, two cobras plotting to kill the family. Rikki-tikki kills Nag in the bathroom and later destroys Nagaina's eggs. In a final confrontation, he follows Nagaina into her hole and kills her, saving the family and securing the garden from future snake threats.

Each story highlights the themes of courage, loyalty, and the struggle for survival in the natural world, with Mowgli, Kotick, and Rikki-tikki overcoming significant challenges to protect their communities and assert their places in the world.
