Anne Shirley is preparing to leave Green Gables to begin a new life with Gilbert Blythe as they plan their wedding and future together. The story unfolds in a small, picturesque village on Prince Edward Island, where Anne and Gilbert are about to embark on married life. The narrative is rich with the beauty of the natural landscape, the charm of the village, and the close-knit community that surrounds them.

Anne, now a schoolteacher, is done with her teaching duties and is ready to settle into married life. Her best friend, Diana Wright, is a matronly figure with a child named Small Anne Cordelia, named in part after Anne herself. Diana and Anne reminisce about their past and discuss Anne's upcoming marriage to Gilbert. They talk about the changes in Avonlea, including the arrival of telephones, which Anne finds both modern and intrusive.

The couple's new home will be at Four Winds Harbor, a beautiful and somewhat remote location sixty miles from Avonlea. Gilbert is set to take over his uncle's medical practice there, and Anne is excited about their new life together, even though it means leaving Green Gables. The couple decides to have a small, intimate wedding at Green Gables, attended by their closest friends and family.

As Anne and Gilbert settle into their new home, they explore their surroundings and meet their neighbors. One of the most intriguing characters they encounter is Captain Jim, the lighthouse keeper, who becomes a close friend and confidant. Captain Jim is a storyteller with a rich past, and his tales captivate Anne and Gilbert. He shares stories of the sea, his adventures, and the history of Four Winds.

Anne also meets Leslie Moore, a beautiful but troubled woman who lives nearby. Leslie's life has been marked by tragedy, as she is married to Dick Moore, a man who suffered a head injury that left him mentally incapacitated. Leslie's life is one of duty and sacrifice, as she cares for Dick, who is more like a child than a husband. Anne and Leslie form a deep friendship, and Anne learns of Leslie's unfulfilled dreams and desires.

The narrative also introduces Owen Ford, a writer who comes to Four Winds to find inspiration for his novel. Owen becomes a close friend of Anne and Gilbert, and he is drawn to Leslie. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Leslie and Owen have feelings for each other, but Leslie's sense of duty to Dick prevents her from pursuing happiness with Owen.

Throughout the story, Anne and Gilbert's love and partnership are a central theme. They navigate the challenges and joys of married life, supported by their friends and community. Anne's journey from a young, imaginative girl to a mature, loving wife is beautifully portrayed, and her relationships with the people of Four Winds enrich her life.

As the story progresses, a medical breakthrough offers hope for Dick Moore's condition. Gilbert discovers that Dick's injury might be treatable, and he faces the ethical dilemma of whether to tell Leslie, knowing it could change her life forever. Anne and Gilbert grapple with the moral implications, and Leslie must decide whether to pursue the treatment that could restore Dick's faculties.

In the end, Leslie's life takes a new turn, and she is given a chance at happiness. Captain Jim's life story is published, fulfilling his lifelong dream, and he passes away peacefully, leaving a legacy of love and friendship. Anne and Gilbert's journey continues, enriched by the experiences and people they have encountered at Four Winds.

The story concludes with Anne and Gilbert preparing to move to a larger home, recognizing that life is full of changes and new beginnings. Anne's house of dreams has been a place of love, growth, and cherished memories, and she carries those experiences with her as she embraces the future with Gilbert by her side.
