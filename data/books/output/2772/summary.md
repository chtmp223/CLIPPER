In the late 19th century, the Pendyce family of Worsted Skeynes, led by the traditionalist Squire Horace Pendyce, is thrown into turmoil when their eldest son, George, becomes embroiled in a scandalous divorce case. George is named as a correspondent in the divorce suit filed by Captain Jaspar Bellew against his wife, Helen Bellew, who has been staying with the Pendyces. The Squire is deeply concerned about the family's reputation and the potential impact on their estate, which has been passed down through generations.

Mrs. Margery Pendyce, George's mother, is caught between her loyalty to her son and her husband's rigid principles. She decides to take matters into her own hands, leaving her husband and the estate temporarily to be with George in London. Her departure is an unprecedented act of defiance, reflecting her desperation to protect her son from the consequences of his actions and her desire to maintain family unity.

Helen Bellew, a charming and independent woman, has grown tired of her marriage to the reckless and disreputable Captain Bellew. Despite her affection for George, she ultimately decides to end their relationship, understanding the societal implications and personal consequences of continuing their affair. Her decision leaves George heartbroken and struggling with his emotions.

Gregory Vigil, a cousin of Mrs. Pendyce and Helen's guardian, is determined to secure a divorce for Helen, believing it is the only way to free her from her untenable situation and protect her future. However, he is frustrated by the legal and moral complexities of the divorce laws of the time, which require evidence of misconduct and make it difficult to obtain a divorce without public scandal.

Throughout the narrative, the Pendyce family grapples with issues of tradition, reputation, and individual desires. The Squire's stubborn adherence to the past and fear of change clash with the evolving social norms and the personal needs of his family members. The story explores the tension between societal expectations and personal happiness, highlighting the challenges faced by individuals in maintaining their integrity and navigating the constraints of their social environment.

As the novel unfolds, characters such as the Reverend Hussell Barter, who represents the conservative religious perspective, and Mr. Paramor, the pragmatic lawyer, provide contrasting viewpoints on the issues of divorce and morality. The story culminates in a resolution that emphasizes the importance of understanding, compassion, and the need for change in a world bound by rigid traditions.

Ultimately, the novel paints a vivid picture of late Victorian society, examining the intersection of personal and societal values, and the impact of change on individuals and families. Through the experiences of the Pendyce family and their associates, it offers a critique of the social and legal systems of the time, while also celebrating the resilience and complexity of human relationships.
