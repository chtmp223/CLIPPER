In the Scottish Highlands, as autumn sets in, the narrator recounts a day spent hunting with his Gordon setter, Dash, in the beautiful yet wild landscape of Glen T----, Ross-shire. The narrator, who is staying with the local minister, reflects on the unchanged nature of the hills despite his many adventures around the world. As night falls, he decides to take a treacherous shortcut along the cliff edge of Eurna to return to the manse, using stones to safely navigate the path in the dark.

Upon reaching a glen he calls Glen Foogle, the narrator is surprised to find a villa where an old Highland hut once stood. The villa, brightly lit with colored lights and Chinese lanterns, belongs to Captain Reeves, a retired sailor. The narrator is warmly invited to join a dinner party there, meeting Reeves' beautiful daughter Mina and her cousin Don Miguel Mâ€˜Lean. The evening is filled with stories of Reeves' seafaring past and the narrator's own adventures.

Reeves shares a tale involving a hidden treasure, a legacy from his ancestor, the Spanish sailor Miguel Bassanto, who sailed with the notorious pirate Henry Morgan. Bassanto's logbook, which Reeves possesses, details the burial of gold on Amelia Island, Florida, after a series of piratical exploits. Reeves, Miguel, and the narrator plan to retrieve this treasure, posing as scientists interested in excavating ancient mounds on the island.

Upon reaching Amelia Island, they befriend locals and begin their excavation under the guise of scientific research. Their true goal is to find the gold buried by Bassanto. After several days of digging, they finally uncover iron boxes filled with gold doubloons. However, their activities arouse suspicion, particularly from a local named George Winkey, who becomes increasingly curious about their true intentions.

As they prepare to transport the treasure to their yacht, Winkey, leading a group of men, confronts them. In the ensuing chaos, Miguel defends the gold and knocks Winkey unconscious, allowing the group to escape. They quickly load the gold onto their yacht and set sail, evading pursuit by heading in a deceptive direction before altering course for home.

Throughout the adventure, Miguel dreams of a future with Mina, hoping their newfound wealth will secure their happiness. The narrative blends elements of adventure, romance, and moral questioning, as the characters navigate their quest for treasure amidst the backdrop of the Scottish Highlands and the exotic allure of the Caribbean.
