Richard Seaton's observation of a copper steam-bath flying out of the window at high speed led to the development of advanced technologies like the object-compass and X-plosive bullet.,Richard Seaton's observation of a copper steam-bath flying out of the window at high speed led to the development of advanced technologies like the space-car and Skylark.,"In Chapter 1, Seaton witnesses the copper steam-bath flying out of the window, which sparks his discovery of intra-atomic energy. This discovery ultimately leads to the development of advanced technologies, as seen in Chapter 5 where Seaton and Crane test the object-compass and X-plosive bullet, both of which are likely based on the principles of intra-atomic energy.","While the space-car and Skylark are indeed advanced technologies in the story, they are not specifically mentioned as being developed in Chapter 5. The corrupted fact replaces the object-compass and X-plosive bullet with these other inventions, making it incorrect based on the given outline.","Chapter 1, 5","- Chapter 1, item 1: Richard Seaton observes a copper steam-bath unexpectedly flying out of the window at high speed.
