In the early afternoon, the small town of Dominion, nestled in a hollow shielded from the harshness of the higher mountains, is introduced as a peaceful place, surrounded by the vibrant colors of late spring. The scene shifts to Barry Houston, a young man with a serious demeanor, who arrives in Dominion in his yellow racer. Barry is on a mission that requires secrecy, as indicated by his decision to remove his nameplate from the car once he leaves the village.

Barry's journey is fraught with challenges as he attempts to cross Hazard Pass, a treacherous mountain route known for its dangers. Despite warnings from a villager about the difficulties of the Pass, Barry is determined to reach Tabernacle on the other side. His journey is marked by the harshness of the elements, with snow and ice making the road perilous. His car, already struggling, eventually suffers a mechanical failure, forcing Barry to continue on foot.

During his trek, Barry reflects on his life, particularly the shadow of a past accusation of murder that had marred his reputation. He recalls the trial and the circumstantial evidence that had nearly convicted him of killing his cousin, Tom Langdon, with a mallet. Despite being acquitted, the stigma of the accusation still haunts him. Barry's thoughts also touch on his father's death and the conditions of the will that left him the mill and lands in Colorado, which he must develop successfully within five years or lose them.

As Barry struggles to reach safety, he encounters Ba'tiste Renaud, a giant French-Canadian trapper, who saves him from the wreckage of his car. Ba'tiste, who has suffered his own tragedies, including the loss of his wife and son, becomes a steadfast ally to Barry. The two men form a bond, with Ba'tiste seeing in Barry the spirit of his lost son, Pierre.

Barry's arrival in Colorado is not without complications. He discovers that Fred Thayer, his father's former manager, has been undermining his efforts to fulfill the conditions of the will. Thayer, along with his accomplice Blackburn, has been sabotaging the mill's operations, causing accidents and inefficiencies to drive Barry out of business. Thayer's ultimate goal is to acquire the mill and its valuable timberlands for himself.

Amidst these challenges, Barry meets Medaine Robinette, a young woman who owns the land on the opposite side of the lake from Barry's timberlands. Despite an initial misunderstanding and distrust fueled by Thayer's machinations, Barry and Medaine form a connection. Medaine, compassionate and strong-willed, offers her assistance in Barry's struggle to save his inheritance.

As the story unfolds, Barry, with the help of Ba'tiste and Medaine, uncovers Thayer's deceit and the extent of the conspiracy against him. The turning point comes when Thayer's accomplice, Agnes Jierdon, confesses to her role in the scheme, revealing the truth about the forged contracts and Thayer's attempts to sabotage Barry's efforts.

In the end, Barry's determination and the support of his friends enable him to overcome the obstacles that had been placed in his path. He fulfills the conditions of his father's will, securing his inheritance and clearing his name. The story concludes with Barry finding not only success in his business endeavors but also a sense of belonging and hope for the future, with Medaine by his side and Ba'tiste as a loyal friend.
