In the remote wilderness north of Rat Portage, a hunting party consisting of Dr. Cathcart, his nephew Simpson, and their guides Hank Davis and Joseph Défago, along with an Indian cook named Punk, sets out in search of elusive moose. The group finds themselves in a desolate camp, surrounded by the vast, silent forest. Défago, a French Canadian with an exceptional understanding of the woods, is chosen by Hank to guide Simpson on a separate expedition across the lake to Fifty Island Water. Despite his initial reluctance, Défago agrees to the plan, though his unease is palpable.

As the two men set out in their canoe, Simpson is captivated by the beauty and enormity of the wilderness, yet he is also aware of its merciless nature. Défago, meanwhile, displays a deep connection to the forest, a bond that borders on obsession. After setting up camp, Défago leaves to scout for moose, leaving Simpson to contemplate the solitude and potential dangers of their surroundings. When Défago returns, he is visibly disturbed, and Simpson notices a change in his demeanor.

That night, Défago is overcome by an inexplicable terror. He begins to sniff the air like an animal, and despite Simpson's attempts to calm him, he becomes increasingly agitated. In the early hours of the morning, Simpson is awakened by Défago's cries and the sound of him fleeing into the forest, shouting about "feet of fire." Alone and terrified, Simpson struggles to understand what has happened. He attempts to track Défago but is bewildered by the strange, enormous tracks that accompany his guide's footprints, suggesting something unnatural.

Simpson returns to camp, exhausted and confused, and waits for the others. When Dr. Cathcart and Hank arrive, they are skeptical of Simpson's account, attributing his experience to hallucinations caused by the wilderness. However, they agree to search for Défago. The search proves fruitless, as fresh snow has covered any tracks, and they are forced to return to camp without finding a trace of the missing guide.

As night falls, the group discusses the legend of the Wendigo, a mythical creature said to haunt the forest, preying on those who hear its call. The tension is palpable, and the men are on edge, fearing the unknown forces at play. Suddenly, they hear a haunting cry from the sky, echoing Défago's earlier words. Moments later, a figure crashes through the trees and collapses near the fire. It is Défago, or what remains of him—a man so changed and distorted that he is barely recognizable.

Hank, overwhelmed by emotion, accuses the figure of not being his old friend. Dr. Cathcart, attempting to maintain order, questions the wretched figure, but the answers are incoherent and terrifying. Défago speaks of being with the Wendigo, and his feet, when revealed, are horribly transformed. Before the group can react, a powerful wind rushes through the camp, and Défago disappears into the forest once more, leaving behind only the echo of his cries.

The next morning, the party returns to their base camp, where they find the real Défago, emaciated and mindless, trying to start a fire. He has no memory of the events or how he survived. The experience has shattered his mind, and he soon succumbs to his injuries. Punk, the Indian cook, who fled the camp in terror upon Défago's return, confirms the presence of the Wendigo, a creature whose myth has now become a dreadful reality for the group.

The story ends with the characters grappling with the implications of their encounter with the Wendigo, a force beyond their understanding, leaving them haunted by the wilderness's mysterious and terrifying power.
