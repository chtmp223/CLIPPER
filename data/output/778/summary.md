The story begins with the children—Cyril, Anthea, Robert, Jane, and their baby brother, affectionately called the Lamb—moving to a white house in the country, which they see as a paradise after living in London. Their adventures unfold when they discover a Psammead, or Sand-fairy, in a gravel pit. The Psammead has the power to grant one wish a day, but each wish only lasts until sunset. The children, excited by the prospect of wishes, soon learn that their desires often lead to unexpected and troublesome outcomes.

Their first wish for beauty results in them becoming unrecognizable, causing confusion and distress. Another wish for wealth leaves them with gold coins that vanish at sunset, leading to a series of misunderstandings with local tradespeople and even the police. As they navigate these challenges, they realize that their wishes require careful consideration, as the Psammead's gifts are often more trouble than they are worth.

The children's adventures continue with a wish for wings, allowing them to fly, but this too ends in chaos when they realize they must be on the ground by sunset to avoid turning to stone. Their wish for a castle leads them to a medieval siege, where they must defend themselves against knights, and a wish for the Lamb to grow up results in a sudden transformation that leaves them with a grown-up brother who has no memory of his past.

Throughout these escapades, the children learn valuable lessons about the consequences of their wishes. They discover that each wish, though initially appealing, often brings unforeseen complications. For example, their wish for the Lamb to grow up teaches them the importance of appreciating their brother as he is, rather than wishing for him to change. Similarly, their experience with the castle siege highlights the importance of thinking through their wishes and the potential dangers of their desires.

In the end, the children realize that the Psammead's power is not a solution to their problems but a catalyst for personal growth and understanding. They come to appreciate the ordinary joys of life and the importance of family, learning to navigate their adventures with a newfound wisdom and caution. As their summer of wishes comes to an end, they are left with a deeper appreciation for the everyday magic of their lives and the bonds they share as siblings.
