In a gripping tale of mystery and deduction, we follow Dr. John Watson and the legendary detective Sherlock Holmes as they unravel a complex case involving a hidden treasure, a series of murders, and a cast of intriguing characters. The story begins with Holmes injecting himself with a seven-percent solution of cocaine, much to Watson's dismay. Holmes explains his need for mental stimulation, which he finds in solving intricate problems as a consulting detective.

Their latest case is brought to them by Miss Mary Morstan, a young woman whose father, Captain Morstan, disappeared ten years ago after returning from India. Since then, she has received a valuable pearl each year from an anonymous benefactor. Recently, she received a mysterious letter requesting a meeting at the Lyceum Theatre, promising justice for a wrong done to her. Holmes, Watson, and Miss Morstan attend the meeting, leading them to Thaddeus Sholto, the nervous and eccentric son of Major Sholto, who served with Captain Morstan in India.

Thaddeus reveals that his father had a treasure from India, which he promised to share with Captain Morstan. However, Morstan died suddenly during a confrontation with Major Sholto, and the treasure was hidden. Thaddeus's brother, Bartholomew, recently discovered the treasure, but when they arrive at his home, Pondicherry Lodge, they find him dead, with a note bearing "The sign of the four" and a thorn in his skin, indicating murder.

Holmes deduces that the murder was committed by Jonathan Small, a convict who had been part of a group that originally possessed the treasure. Small had a wooden leg and was accompanied by a savage Andaman Islander named Tonga, who used poisoned darts. Holmes and Watson, with the help of a dog named Toby, track the scent of creosote left by the criminals to the river, where they learn that Small and Tonga have escaped by boat.

As Holmes and Watson work to locate the steam launch, the Aurora, they employ the Baker Street Irregulars, a group of street children, to help in the search. Meanwhile, Holmes disguises himself to gather information, ultimately discovering that Small and Tonga are planning to flee with the treasure. Holmes arranges for a police launch to intercept them.

In a thrilling chase down the Thames, Holmes, Watson, and the police capture Small, though Tonga is killed in the pursuit. The treasure, however, is found to be missing, having been dumped overboard by Small in a fit of rage, preferring to see it lost than shared with his enemies. Small is arrested, and he recounts his tale of betrayal and vengeance, explaining how the treasure brought nothing but misery to those who sought it.

Throughout the investigation, Watson becomes enamored with Miss Morstan, but he fears that the treasure will place her beyond his reach. However, with the treasure lost, Watson declares his love for her, and she reciprocates, grateful for the resolution of her father's mysterious disappearance and the clearing of Thaddeus Sholto's name.

The case concludes with Holmes reflecting on the nature of crime and justice, and Watson finding happiness in his engagement to Mary Morstan, while Holmes returns to his habitual use of cocaine, ever in search of the next mental challenge.
