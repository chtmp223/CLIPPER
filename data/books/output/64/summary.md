In the gripping narrative set on the planet Barsoom, John Carter, a former Earthman and now a Prince of Helium, finds himself embroiled in a desperate struggle to save his beloved Dejah Thoris and uncover the dark secrets of the Martian religions. The story unfolds with Carter's unexpected return to Mars after ten years, only to discover the deceptions of the Holy Therns and the First Born, who manipulate the beliefs of Barsoom's inhabitants for their own gain.

Carter's journey begins with his capture by the Therns, a race of deceitful priests who enforce the false religion of Issus, leading pilgrims to their deaths in the Valley Dor. Alongside Tars Tarkas, a green Martian chieftain and ally, Carter battles the monstrous plant men and white apes that inhabit this treacherous valley. Their escape leads them to the discovery of a vast subterranean world beneath the polar ice, where the First Born, a race of black Martians, reside.

The narrative intricately weaves through Carter's capture and subsequent trials at the hands of the First Born, led by the cruel goddess Issus. Here, Carter learns of the true fate awaiting those who follow the River Iss, including Dejah Thoris, who is imprisoned in the Temple of Issus. As Carter navigates the political and social structures of the First Born, he encounters Phaidor, the daughter of the Holy Thern leader Matai Shang, who becomes infatuated with him.

Despite the challenges, Carter's resolve to rescue Dejah Thoris remains unshaken. He orchestrates a daring escape with the help of Thuvia, a fellow prisoner and former slave of the Therns, and Xodar, a disgraced First Born officer. Together, they uncover the oppressive systems that have kept the truth hidden from Barsoom's people.

As Carter and his companions fight their way through the Temple of Issus, they face relentless adversaries, including the black pirates of Barsoom, who raid the Therns and First Born alike. The narrative crescendos in a battle for freedom and truth, with Carter leading an uprising against the tyrannical forces that have held sway over Barsoom for centuries.

Throughout the story, themes of love, loyalty, and the quest for truth are explored against the backdrop of a richly imagined Martian landscape. Carter's unwavering dedication to Dejah Thoris and his commitment to exposing the lies of the Therns and First Born highlight his heroic character and the enduring power of love and justice.

In the end, Carter's journey is not just a personal quest but a fight for the liberation of an entire planet from the chains of superstition and tyranny. His actions set the stage for a new era on Barsoom, where the truth can finally emerge from the shadows, offering hope for a future free from the deceptions of the past.
