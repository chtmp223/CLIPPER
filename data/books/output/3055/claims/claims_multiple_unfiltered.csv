The descriptions are slightly varied from the original observation.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful, as it connects Walter's initial observation of the three passengers with his later vision, indicating a continuity in his experiences and perceptions.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly grounded in the chapter outline, where both the initial observation and the later vision are described.

""reappear as physical beings to him later"": This part is grounded in Chapter 3, event 5, where Walter has a vision of three figures, described as a misshapen man, a pretty maid, and a noble lady. However, it is important to note that these figures are described as a vision, not as physical beings.
   c. ""with no variations in their descriptions"": This part is not entirely accurate. In Chapter 2, the passengers are described as a dwarf, a maiden, and a stately lady. In Chapter 3, the vision is of a misshapen man, a pretty maid, and a noble lady. The descriptions are similar but not identical, indicating a variation.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not entirely valid because the claim suggests that the figures reappear as physical beings with no variations in their descriptions, which is not supported by the chapter outline. The figures reappear as a vision, and there are slight variations in their descriptions.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation but is not explicitly grounded in the chapter outline due to the discrepancies in the descriptions and the nature of the reappearance (vision vs. physical beings).
   c. The relationship does not contradict the summary but is not fully supported by the chapter outline due to the differences noted above.
