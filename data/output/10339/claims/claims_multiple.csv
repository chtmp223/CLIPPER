   a. ""The fate of the Jane's crew on Tsalal Island involved two separate catastrophic events"": This part is grounded in the chapter outlines and the book summary. The chapter outlines describe a landslip and an ambush by natives as catastrophic events.
   b. ""a landslip that buried William Guy and 28 companions, killing 22"": This part is grounded in Chapter 24, event 2, where a landslip kills 22 of the crew.

Chapter 4 mentions an ambush by the natives of Tsalal that killed most of the Jane's crew, leaving only Pym and Peters to escape. However, Chapter 24 outlines additional events, such as a landslip that killed 22 crew members and the subsequent hiding of survivors, indicating that the crew's fate involved more than just the ambush.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not entirely valid because the claim oversimplifies the fate of the Jane's crew by attributing it solely to the ambush, ignoring the landslip and other events described in Chapter 24.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation, as it does not fully account for the multiple events affecting the crew's fate.
   c. The relationship does not contradict the summary or outline but fails to capture the complexity of the events described.
