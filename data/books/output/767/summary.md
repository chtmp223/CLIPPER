The narrative follows Agnes Grey, a young governess navigating the complexities of her profession and personal life in 19th-century England. Agnes, the daughter of a clergyman, seeks employment to support her family after financial difficulties arise. Her first position is with the Bloomfield family, where she encounters unruly children and indifferent parents. Despite her efforts, Agnes is unable to manage the children effectively, leading to her dismissal.

Agnes then secures a position with the Murray family, where she faces new challenges. The Murrays are wealthier and more socially prominent, but their children, Rosalie and Matilda, are similarly difficult. Rosalie, the elder, is vain and focused on attracting suitors, while Matilda is a tomboy uninterested in societal norms. Agnes perseveres, forming a bond with Rosalie despite her flaws.

Throughout her employment, Agnes maintains a sense of duty and morality, often reflecting on her own upbringing and values. She finds solace in her faith and the natural world, particularly during solitary walks by the sea. Her interactions with Mr. Weston, a curate, introduce a potential romantic interest, though Agnes remains cautious and reserved.

As Rosalie prepares to enter society, Agnes observes her reckless pursuit of marriage prospects, including a flirtation with the clergyman Mr. Hatfield. Rosalie eventually marries Sir Thomas Ashby, a wealthy but morally questionable man, leading to a life of dissatisfaction and regret. Agnes, meanwhile, continues to focus on her responsibilities and her family's well-being.

The novel concludes with Agnes leaving her position at the Murrays' and returning home. She finds fulfillment in a simpler life, dedicated to her family and her own principles. Her relationship with Mr. Weston develops into mutual affection, offering the promise of a future built on shared values and mutual respect. Through Agnes's journey, the narrative explores themes of social class, morality, and the challenges faced by women in the pursuit of independence and personal integrity.
