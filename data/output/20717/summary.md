Through the curtained windows of Mrs. Horace Hignett's furnished flat in New York, the golden sunlight of a fine summer morning peeped in. Mrs. Hignett, a world-famous writer on Theosophy, was in America on a lecturing tour. She had left her beloved home, Windles, in Hampshire, England, in the care of her son, Eustace Hignett, who had accompanied her to America. Eustace was kept under his mother's watchful eye, as she dreaded the thought of him marrying and bringing a strange woman to Windles.

Mrs. Hignett's morning was disturbed by the arrival of her nephew, Sam Marlowe, who had just returned from a trip to America. Sam, a young man with a brown and amiable face, was not particularly fond of his aunt, who disapproved of him. Their conversation was awkward, with Sam trying to make small talk and Mrs. Hignett being curt and disapproving.

Sam was sailing back to England on the same ship as Eustace, the "Atlantic." Before leaving, Mrs. Hignett was visited by Bream Mortimer, a friend of the family, who informed her that Eustace was planning to marry Wilhelmina Bennett, a girl he had met in America. Mrs. Hignett was horrified and determined to stop the marriage, as she believed Wilhelmina was not suitable for her son.

On the ship, Sam met Wilhelmina Bennett, known as Billie, and was immediately smitten by her. Unbeknownst to him, Billie was the same girl Eustace intended to marry. Sam, unaware of the connection, was determined to win her heart.

Eustace, heartbroken after his engagement to Billie was broken off due to a misunderstanding involving his mother, confided in Sam. Eustace had been prevented from marrying Billie because Mrs. Hignett had taken all his trousers to stop him from leaving the house.

Sam, meanwhile, continued to pursue Billie, who was initially engaged to Bream Mortimer. Through various comedic misunderstandings and a series of events involving mistaken identities and practical jokes, Sam and Billie grew closer.

Back in England, Mrs. Hignett returned to Windles to find that Eustace had let the house to Rufus Bennett, Billie's father, without her knowledge. This led to further complications as Mr. Bennett and his friend, Mr. Mortimer, took residence at Windles.

Sam, determined to win Billie, devised a plan with Webster, the valet, to kidnap Billie's beloved dog, hoping to return it and win her gratitude. However, the plan went awry, leading to more chaos and misunderstandings.

Eventually, through a series of comedic events, including mistaken identities, a ship's concert gone wrong, and a dramatic night at Windles involving burglars, Sam and Billie realized their love for each other. Despite the initial disapproval of their families, they decided to marry.

The story concludes with Sam and Billie eloping to London to get married, leaving behind the chaos at Windles and the disapproving relatives. The comedic tale of misunderstandings, mistaken identities, and love triumphing over obstacles ends on a happy note, with Sam and Billie looking forward to their future together.
