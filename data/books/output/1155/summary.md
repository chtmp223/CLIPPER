In the early 20th century, two young friends, Tommy Beresford and Prudence "Tuppence" Cowley, find themselves jobless and broke after World War I. To improve their fortunes, they decide to form a partnership called "The Young Adventurers, Ltd.," offering their services for any kind of work, especially adventures. Their first break comes when Tuppence is approached by a mysterious man named Whittington, who offers her a lucrative job if she assumes the identity of a girl named Jane Finn. Sensing something amiss, Tuppence becomes intrigued and decides to investigate further.

Jane Finn is a young American woman who was aboard the Lusitania when it was sunk by a German U-boat during the war. She was entrusted with secret documents vital to the Allies' war effort, but she disappeared after the sinking. The documents are believed to be a draft treaty, which, if exposed, could destabilize the British government and aid revolutionary forces.

Tommy and Tuppence's investigation leads them to a web of espionage involving a shadowy figure known only as "Mr. Brown," who is orchestrating a conspiracy against the British government. The duo encounters various characters, including Julius P. Hersheimmer, a wealthy American searching for his cousin Jane Finn, and Sir James Peel Edgerton, a prominent lawyer who becomes their ally.

As they delve deeper, Tommy and Tuppence face numerous dangers, including being kidnapped and nearly killed. They learn that Mr. Brown is a master of disguise and manipulation, with agents embedded throughout society. Despite the odds, they manage to uncover the truth about Jane Finn and the whereabouts of the secret documents.

In a climactic confrontation, it is revealed that Sir James Peel Edgerton himself is Mr. Brown. The Young Adventurers, with the help of their allies, manage to thwart his plans and retrieve the documents. Jane Finn is found safe, and the conspiracy is dismantled.

Throughout their journey, Tommy and Tuppence's friendship deepens, and they realize their feelings for each other. The adventure concludes with the promise of a shared future, both professionally and personally, as they plan to continue their partnership in solving mysteries and embarking on new adventures.
