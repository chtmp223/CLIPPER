In a dystopian future where individuality is forbidden and society is governed by strict collectivism, a young man named Equality 7-2521 struggles with his innate curiosity and desire for knowledge. Set in a world where the concept of the individual has been erased, the story unfolds in a society where people live and work for the collective good, and personal choice is nonexistent. Equality 7-2521, a street sweeper, is burdened by his intelligence and height, which set him apart from his peers and earn him the disapproval of the Teachers and Leaders. Despite the oppressive societal norms, he harbors a secret yearning for understanding and knowledge, particularly in the field of science.

As a child, Equality 7-2521 is reprimanded for his curiosity and preference for certain subjects, a transgression in a world where all men must be alike. He dreams of becoming a Scholar, but the Council of Vocations assigns him to the role of a Street Sweeper, a position he accepts with outward compliance. However, his internal rebellion persists, and he discovers a hidden underground tunnel from the Unmentionable Times, a relic from an era before the Great Rebirth when individualism was still known.

In the tunnel, Equality 7-2521 conducts clandestine experiments, driven by a relentless quest for knowledge. He discovers electricity, a power unknown to his society, and creates a light bulb. This discovery fills him with a sense of purpose and the realization that he must share this knowledge with the World Council of Scholars, hoping it will earn him a place among them and change the world.

Parallel to his scientific endeavors, Equality 7-2521 develops a forbidden romantic interest in a woman named Liberty 5-3000, whom he secretly calls the Golden One. Despite the laws prohibiting personal relationships, they share a mutual attraction and communicate through subtle gestures, defying the societal norms that dictate their lives.

When Equality 7-2521 is caught returning late from his experiments, he is imprisoned and tortured in the Palace of Corrective Detention. Despite the pain, he refuses to reveal his secret. He eventually escapes and decides to reveal his discovery to the World Council of Scholars. However, when he presents his invention, the Scholars react with fear and hostility, condemning his actions and threatening to destroy his creation. In a moment of desperation, Equality 7-2521 seizes his invention and flees to the Uncharted Forest, a forbidden place where no one dares to go.

In the forest, Equality 7-2521 experiences a profound sense of freedom and self-discovery. He realizes the joy of living for himself, unburdened by the constraints of collectivism. To his surprise, Liberty 5-3000 follows him into the forest, declaring her love and willingness to share his fate. Together, they explore the forest and eventually find a house from the Unmentionable Times, filled with books and remnants of a past civilization.

As they settle into their new home, Equality 7-2521 discovers the concept of "I" through the books he reads. This revelation transforms his understanding of himself and the world, leading him to adopt the name Prometheus, after the mythological figure who brought fire to mankind. He names Liberty 5-3000 Gaea, envisioning her as the mother of a new generation of free individuals.

With a renewed sense of purpose, Prometheus plans to rebuild the achievements of the past and create a new society based on individual freedom and self-worth. He envisions a future where he will gather others who share his spirit of independence, leading them to a new life in the wilderness. Prometheus reflects on the history of mankind, recognizing that the true enemy of freedom is the collectivist worship of the word "We." He vows to fight for the rights and dignity of the individual, carving the word "EGO" above the entrance of his new home as a symbol of his newfound philosophy.

In this tale of self-discovery and rebellion against conformity, Equality 7-2521's journey from a nameless cog in a collectivist machine to an individual with a sense of identity and purpose serves as a powerful narrative of the triumph of the human spirit over oppression.
