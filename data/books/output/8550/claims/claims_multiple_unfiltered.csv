- Relationship: Cause and effect",Unique,Valid claim,INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""After being thrown into Lake Conowingo as punishment"": This part is grounded in event 6 of Chapter 1, where Hicks is thrown into the lake by his teammates.
   b. ""Hicks mysteriously disappears before the football squad returns from morning practice"": This part is grounded in events 6 and 7 of Chapter 2, where Hicks disappears after leaving a letter stating he is ""hot on the trail of a fullback.""

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is temporal and sequential, as Hicks is thrown into the lake in Chapter 1 and then disappears in Chapter 2. However, the claim implies a direct causal relationship between the two events, which is not explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
   b. The relationship is not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline, as there is no direct indication that being thrown into the lake is related to his disappearance.
   c. The relationship does not contradict any information in the summary or outline, but it is not explicitly supported either.

   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline that Hicks left to find a fullback and returned with Thor.
