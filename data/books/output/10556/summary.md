In a series of mysterious crimes and investigations, a peculiar and enigmatic man with a penchant for solving cases through deductive reasoning engages in discussions with Miss Polly Burton, a journalist. This man, known only for his nervous habits and constant manipulation of a piece of string, unravels several baffling mysteries, each with its intricate details and seemingly impenetrable secrets.

One such case is the Fenchurch Street mystery, where a man named William Kershaw disappears after arranging a meeting with a wealthy acquaintance, Francis Smethurst. The mystery deepens when Kershaw is later found dead, and Smethurst is accused of murder. However, the man in the corner suggests that Kershaw had cleverly assumed Smethurst's identity, committing the murder himself to escape financial ruin.

Another case involves the mysterious death on the underground railway, where Mrs. Hazeldene is found dead with no apparent cause. The investigation reveals a tangled web of relationships and potential motives, but the man in the corner deduces that the crime was committed by someone close to her, possibly her husband, using a ring with a hidden needle to administer poison.

In the Edinburgh mystery, Lady Donaldson is found murdered, and suspicion falls on her godson's fianc√©e, Edith Crawford. Despite evidence suggesting her guilt, the man in the corner believes the true murderer was someone within the household, motivated by financial gain and familial ties.

The Liverpool mystery presents a case of a jewel theft involving a supposed Russian prince and his secretary. The man in the corner theorizes that the theft was orchestrated by an insider, Mr. Vassall, who had the opportunity and motive to commit the crime.

In another case, the English Provident Bank is robbed, and suspicion falls on the manager, Mr. Ireland. The man in the corner reveals that the manager's son, Robert Ireland, was the true culprit, using his mother's help to cover his tracks.

The Dublin mystery centers around the forged will of a wealthy man, leading to the murder of a lawyer. The man in the corner suggests that the deceased's son, Murray Brooks, orchestrated the forgery and murder to secure his inheritance.

In the Brighton outrage, Mr. Francis Morton is found bound and gagged, claiming to have been robbed. The man in the corner suspects Morton himself staged the crime to cover up a blackmail scheme involving his wife.

The Regent's Park murder involves the death of a man named Aaron Cohen, with suspicion falling on a young man, John Ashley. The man in the corner deduces that Ashley and his friend concocted an elaborate plan to commit the murder and create an alibi.

Finally, the mysterious death in Percy Street involves the caretaker, Mrs. Owen, found dead in her room. The man in the corner suggests her death was orchestrated by a relative who manipulated circumstances to appear as an accident or suicide.

Throughout these cases, the man in the corner consistently demonstrates his ability to see beyond the obvious, using logic and deduction to reveal the truth behind each mystery. His insights often highlight the failures of the police and the complexity of human motives, leaving Polly Burton both intrigued and challenged by his unconventional methods.
