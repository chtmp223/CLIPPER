Nagendra Natha Datta, a wealthy zemindar from Zillah Govindpur, embarks on a boat journey during the stormy month of Joisto, despite his wife Surja Mukhi's concerns for his safety. His journey is interrupted by a fierce storm, forcing Nagendra to seek shelter in a nearby village. There, he encounters a destitute young girl named Kunda Nandini, who has just lost her father and is left alone in the world. Moved by her plight, Nagendra decides to take Kunda to Calcutta, hoping to find her relatives.

In Calcutta, Nagendra entrusts Kunda to his sister Kamal Mani, who is married to Srish Chandra Mittra. Kamal Mani takes a liking to Kunda and cares for her, while Nagendra becomes increasingly captivated by Kunda's beauty and innocence. This growing infatuation begins to strain Nagendra's marriage to Surja Mukhi, who becomes aware of her husband's feelings for Kunda. Despite her anguish, Surja Mukhi arranges for Kunda to marry Tara Charan, a schoolmaster and a family friend, hoping to remove the source of tension in her marriage.

However, Tara Charan's untimely death leaves Kunda a widow, and she returns to live with Nagendra and Surja Mukhi. Nagendra's unresolved feelings for Kunda continue to cause turmoil in his marriage, leading Surja Mukhi to feel increasingly isolated and betrayed. In a moment of despair, Surja Mukhi leaves her home, wandering aimlessly until she is found by a kind Brahmachari who tends to her needs.

Meanwhile, Nagendra, tormented by guilt and longing for his wife, sets out to find Surja Mukhi. His journey is fraught with challenges, and he eventually receives a letter informing him of Surja Mukhi's whereabouts. However, by the time he reaches her, she has already succumbed to illness and passed away, leaving Nagendra devastated.

Back in Govindpur, Kunda Nandini struggles with her own feelings of guilt and helplessness. She feels responsible for the discord between Nagendra and Surja Mukhi and is unable to find solace in her new life. In a tragic turn of events, Kunda, overwhelmed by her emotions, takes her own life, leaving Nagendra to grapple with the loss of both women he cared for deeply.

The narrative also explores the lives of other characters, such as Debendra, a cousin of Nagendra, who leads a life of excess and moral decay. His interactions with Hira, a servant in Nagendra's household, lead to further complications and ultimately contribute to the tragic events that unfold.

Throughout the story, themes of love, duty, and the consequences of unchecked desires are explored, set against the backdrop of societal norms and personal relationships. The characters' struggles with their emotions and the impact of their choices highlight the complexities of human nature and the often-painful pursuit of happiness.
