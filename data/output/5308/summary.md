In a quaint English cathedral town, Wrychester, a mysterious death occurs, setting off a chain of events filled with intrigue and hidden pasts. The peaceful setting of the town is disrupted when a stranger, known as John Braden, is found dead at the foot of St. Wrytha's Stair in the cathedral. The local doctor, Mark Ransford, is visibly agitated upon hearing the news, raising suspicions about his connection to the deceased.

Dr. Pemberton Bryce, Ransford's assistant, is dismissed after making unwelcome advances toward Mary Bewery, Ransford's ward. However, Bryce is not easily deterred and decides to stay in Wrychester to uncover the mysteries surrounding Ransford and Braden. His investigation reveals that Braden was actually John Brake, a man with a criminal past who had been seeking revenge against those who wronged him, including a former friend, Falkiner Wraye, now living in Wrychester under the name Stephen Folliot.

Bryce's discovery of a cryptic note in Braden's possession leads him to suspect that a secret is hidden in the cathedral's Paradise area, near the tomb of Richard Jenkins. Meanwhile, the police, led by Inspector Mitchington, are also investigating the case, suspecting foul play due to the peculiar circumstances of Braden's death and the subsequent poisoning of a witness, Collishaw.

As Bryce delves deeper, he learns about Ransford's past connections with Brake and a mysterious disappearance involving Brake's wife and children years ago. Bryce's suspicions grow, believing Ransford might have been involved in Brake's downfall and possibly his death.

The investigation takes a turn when Bryce discovers that Mary and her brother Dick are actually Brake's children, unaware of their true lineage. Bryce's manipulative intentions to use this information for his gain are foiled by Mary, who remains steadfast in her trust of Ransford.

The climax unfolds when Bryce confronts Folliot, seeking to leverage his knowledge for personal advantage. However, Folliot, cornered by the police, takes drastic action, killing Bryce and himself to prevent further revelations. The truth about Brake's identity and the long-buried secrets of betrayal and revenge come to light, clearing Ransford of suspicion.

In the end, the intertwined fates of the characters reveal a tale of friendship turned sour, love lost, and the relentless pursuit of truth. The story concludes with Ransford preparing to share the full truth with Mary and Dick, promising a future free of the shadows of the past.
