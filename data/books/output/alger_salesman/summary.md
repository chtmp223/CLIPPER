Scott Walton, a sixteen-year-old boy, is traveling from Liverpool to New York on the sailing ship Arcturus with his father, who is in the last stages of consumption. Scott's father, Mr. Walton, reveals to Scott that he is dying and will not live to see New York. He gives Scott a wallet containing twenty pounds and tells him about two relatives in America: Ezra Little in New York and Philo Walton in the Western States. Mr. Walton dies on the ship, and Scott is left alone and fatherless.

Upon arriving in New York, Scott encounters Crawford Lane, a young man who offers to help him find his way in the city. Scott is initially grateful for the companionship, but Lane proves to be untrustworthy, stealing part of Scott's money. Scott eventually recovers some of the stolen money with the help of a new acquaintance, Justin Wood, a wealthy young man who takes an interest in Scott's welfare.

Scott decides to seek out his mother's cousin, Ezra Little, who owns a dry-goods store on Eighth Avenue. Ezra is a shrewd and frugal man who offers Scott a place to stay and a job in his store, but only after taking all of Scott's money as compensation for his board. Scott moves into a small, windowless room in the Little household and begins working in the store, where he quickly proves himself to be a capable salesman.

Despite the cold treatment from Ezra and his son Loammi, Scott perseveres and makes the best of his situation. He finds a friend in Seth Lawton, an older relative who turns out to be wealthier than anyone suspects. Seth helps Scott and eventually plays a crucial role in saving Ezra Little from financial ruin by offering a substantial loan.

Scott's fortunes improve significantly when he is sent on a business trip by Tower, Douglas & Co., the firm he works for. He successfully negotiates a large purchase of goods, earning a substantial commission and a salary increase. Scott's success in business, along with his friendship with the Earl of Windermere, elevates his social standing and leads to invitations to exclusive events.

Throughout his journey, Scott remains humble and focused on his goals. He honors his father's memory by seeking out and helping Robert Kent, an old friend of his father's who has fallen on hard times. Scott's integrity and determination ultimately lead to his success, both professionally and personally, as he builds a prosperous future for himself while maintaining his values and helping those around him.
