In the opening chapter, we are introduced to Sir Charles, Lady Wray, and Mr. Gillett, a police agent, aboard the ship Lord Nelson, en route to Australia. They discuss the convicts below deck, among them the notorious 'Frisco Pet, a former prizefighter turned criminal. The ship's captain, Macpherson, is stern and no-nonsense, indicative of the ship's disciplined environment. Among the passengers is a young girl, Jocelyn Wray, who is curious about the convicts.

The narrative then shifts to John Steele, a lawyer in London, who is embroiled in a complex case. He is a man with a mysterious past, having been rescued from a deserted isle after the wreck of the Mary Vernon, a story that parallels the fate of the Lord Nelson. Steele is described as a man of intellect and physical prowess, with a hidden history that he is determined to uncover, particularly regarding a crime for which he was wrongfully convicted.

The story unfolds with Steele's interactions with various characters, including Sir Charles and his niece, Jocelyn, whom he meets at a social event. The two share a connection, though Steele is haunted by his past and the danger it poses to his present. Lord Ronsdale, another key character, is introduced as a potential suitor for Jocelyn, but he harbors secrets and a connection to Steele's past.

As the plot thickens, Steele's investigation leads him to confront Tom Rogers, a former convict who holds crucial information about Steele's wrongful conviction. The confrontation is physical and intense, revealing Steele's desperation and determination to clear his name. Meanwhile, Lord Ronsdale, aware of Steele's true identity, plots to use this knowledge to his advantage.

The narrative is interspersed with flashbacks to Steele's time on the deserted island, his struggle for survival, and his eventual rescue. These experiences have shaped him into the man he is, driven by a need for justice and redemption.

The climax occurs when Steele, armed with evidence of his innocence, confronts Lord Ronsdale. The confrontation is tense, with Steele leveraging the truth to force Ronsdale to abandon his pursuit of Jocelyn. The resolution sees Steele preparing to leave London, his name cleared, but his future uncertain.

Throughout the story, themes of justice, identity, and redemption are explored, with Steele's journey serving as a testament to the human spirit's resilience. Jocelyn's character provides a counterpoint to Steele's darkness, her presence a beacon of hope and renewal.

The setting shifts between the grim streets of London and the opulent homes of the elite, reflecting the duality of Steele's existence. The narrative weaves together elements of mystery, romance, and drama, culminating in a satisfying, if open-ended, conclusion.
