At six o'clock the sun disappeared behind a thick curtain of mist. After midnight the breeze freshened, and the _Halbrane's_ progress marked a dozen additional miles.

On the morrow the good ship was less than the third of a degree, that is to say less than twenty miles, from Tsalal Island.

Unfortunately, just after mid-day, the wind fell. Nevertheless, thanks to the current, the Island of Tsalal was signalled at forty-five minutes past six in the evening.

The anchor was cast, a watch was set, with loaded firearms within hand-reach, and boarding-nets ready.

The _Halbrane_ ran no risk of being surprised. Too many eyes were  watching on board--especially those of Hunt, whose gaze never  quitted the horizon of that southern zone for an instant.
