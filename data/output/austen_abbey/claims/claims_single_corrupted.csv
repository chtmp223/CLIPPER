   a. ""Henry Tilney defied his father's orders to forget Catherine"": This part is grounded in events 6 and 7 of Chapter 31, where Henry explains to Catherine that he defied his father's orders and journeyed to Fullerton to propose to her.
   b. ""by journeying to Fullerton to see her instead of accompanying his father to Herefordshire"": This part is also grounded in event 7 of Chapter 31, where it is mentioned that Henry refused to accompany his father to Herefordshire and instead went to Fullerton to see Catherine.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. Henry's defiance of his father's orders is directly linked to his decision to journey to Fullerton instead of going to Herefordshire, as stated in the chapter outline.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.

   a. ""Henry Tilney obeyed his father's orders to forget Catherine"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. In fact, the outline states that Henry defied his father's orders to forget Catherine and instead journeyed to Fullerton to propose to her (events 6 and 7).
   b. ""by accompanying him to Herefordshire instead of journeying to Fullerton"": This part is directly contradicted by the chapter outline, which states that Henry refused to accompany his father to Herefordshire and went to Fullerton instead (event 7).

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:

   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation but rather a misrepresentation of the events described in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it contradicts the outlined events.
