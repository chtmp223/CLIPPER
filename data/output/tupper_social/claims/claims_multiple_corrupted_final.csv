   b. ""to fulfill Sir Thomas's condition that Maria would receive money only if she married a wealthy man"": This part is not explicitly grounded in the chapter outline or the book summary. Sir Thomas's condition, as stated in both the summary and Chapter 1 outline, is that Maria would receive money only if she married a wealthy man. However, John's actions are motivated by his own deceitful plans to manipulate the situation for his benefit, not to fulfill Sir Thomas's condition.

   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as John's actions are driven by his own deceitful motives rather than an intention to meet Sir Thomas's condition.
