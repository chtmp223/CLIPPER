Curdie, the son of Peter the miner, lives with his parents in a cottage on a mountain. They work in the king's mines, extracting silver to serve the kingdom. The mountain, a place of beauty and danger, is home to mysterious goblins who once posed a threat to Princess Irene, the king's daughter. Curdie's bravery and loyalty to the princess earned him the king's favor, though he chose to remain with his family rather than join the royal court.

A year after the goblin threat, Curdie embarks on a journey across desolate heaths and through unfriendly villages, where the locals mock him. He encounters a strange creature, Lina, who becomes his companion. Lina, once a goblin creature, is now loyal to Curdie. They traverse forests and gather a band of grotesque, loyal animals. Their journey leads them to the city of Gwyntystorm, where they find corruption and neglect. Curdie, with Lina and the creatures, confronts hostile butchers and dogs, defending themselves against aggression.

Curdie's mission, guided by Princess Irene's great-great-grandmother, is to restore justice in the kingdom. In the palace, they find the king ill and surrounded by treacherous courtiers. Curdie discovers that Dr. Kelman, the king's physician, is poisoning him. With Lina's help, Curdie stops the doctor and begins to cleanse the palace of deceitful servants and officials. The king gradually recovers, aided by Curdie's vigilance and the companionship of a child named Barbara, who soothes him during his troubled dreams.

Curdie's task is to save the kingdom from internal decay and external threats. He learns from the old princess that his hands have been gifted with the ability to discern the true nature of people by touch. This gift aids him in identifying those who are corrupt and those who are genuine. Curdie uses this ability to gather a new, honest court around the king.

As the king's health improves, Curdie prepares to face an invading army from the neighboring kingdom of Borsagrass. With the help of Lina and the creatures, as well as a flock of pigeons led by the princess's magic, they successfully repel the invaders. The king, now fully recovered, rewards Curdie and his allies for their bravery and loyalty.

Curdie's journey is one of growth and understanding. He learns to trust in the guidance of the old princess and to recognize the hidden truths about people and situations. His actions lead to the restoration of justice and order in the kingdom, and he is recognized as a hero and a future leader. The story concludes with the promise of a brighter future for the kingdom, thanks to the courage and integrity of Curdie and his companions.
