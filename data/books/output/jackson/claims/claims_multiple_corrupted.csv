   b. ""a concealed passage between walls leading to the dining room"": This part is grounded in Chapter 14, event 2, where a hidden passage between walls leading to the dining room is discovered.

   a. The relationship is not meaningful because the claim incorrectly associates the attic with the discoveries made in the cellar and the passage between walls. The events described are not connected to the attic, and the claim misrepresents the locations of these findings.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the claim inaccurately describes the locations of the discoveries.
