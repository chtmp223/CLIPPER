In the late 19th century, James Starr, a retired engineer from Edinburgh, receives a mysterious letter from Simon Ford, a former overman of the Aberfoyle coal mines, requesting his presence at the Yarrow shaft of the Dochart pit. Intrigued by the prospect of a significant discovery, Starr embarks on a journey to the abandoned mines, despite receiving a second letter advising him not to go. Upon arrival, he is met by Harry Ford, Simon's son, who leads him to the Ford familyâ€™s subterranean home.

The Fords, consisting of Simon, his wife Madge, and their son Harry, have continued to live in the mines even after their closure, driven by Simon's unwavering belief in the existence of untapped coal seams. Simon reveals to Starr that he has discovered traces of fire-damp, indicating the presence of a new coal seam. Excited by the prospect, Starr joins the Fords in exploring the mine further.

Their exploration leads them to a vast underground cavern, which they name New Aberfoyle. The discovery is significant, suggesting the possibility of a new, extensive coal seam. However, their excitement is tempered by a series of mysterious and potentially dangerous incidents, including the blocking of their return path by an unknown assailant. These events suggest the presence of someone with a vested interest in keeping the mine's secrets hidden.

Meanwhile, Jack Ryan, a jovial friend of Harry's, becomes concerned when Harry fails to attend a festival they had planned to enjoy together. Jack's concern grows upon learning of Starr's disappearance from Edinburgh. He travels to the Yarrow shaft, only to find the lower ladders removed, preventing access to the mine. Jack reports this to the authorities, and a rescue party is organized.

The rescue team, led by Sir William Elphiston, discovers that the Ford family and Starr have been trapped in the mine for ten days, surviving only through the mysterious provision of bread and water. The party also encounters a strange, elusive light, which leads them to the trapped group, suggesting the presence of a benevolent but secretive helper.

As the narrative unfolds, it becomes clear that the mines are haunted by the figure of Silfax, an old miner believed to be dead, who has been living in the depths of the mine. Silfax, driven by a belief that the mines belong to him, has been orchestrating the mysterious events to protect his perceived domain. His granddaughter, Nell, who has lived with him in the mine, is discovered by Harry and becomes a central figure in unraveling the mystery.

Nell, initially silent about her past, eventually reveals her connection to Silfax, explaining her grandfather's actions and motivations. Her presence in the mine and her subsequent rescue by Harry play a crucial role in the unfolding drama. As tensions escalate, Silfax's actions threaten the safety of all involved, leading to a climactic confrontation.

In the end, the mystery of the mine is resolved, with the discovery of the new coal seam promising a revival of the Aberfoyle mines. The narrative concludes with the marriage of Harry and Nell, symbolizing a new beginning for the Ford family and the mining community. The story, rich with themes of mystery, adventure, and the enduring human spirit, captures the imagination with its blend of scientific exploration and supernatural intrigue.
