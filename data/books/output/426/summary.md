John Varey Nicholson, a well-meaning but somewhat foolish young man, finds himself entangled in a series of misadventures due to his cheerful and careless approach to life. Despite his good nature, John is often at odds with his stern father, Mr. Nicholson, who is deeply committed to the rigid Disruption Principles of the Scottish church. John’s family includes his timid sister Maria and his clever, sickly younger brother Alexander. The family resides in Randolph Crescent, Edinburgh, a citadel of propriety and silence, especially on Sundays.

John's closest friend is Alan Houston, a slightly older, idle heir to a good estate. Their friendship is a source of jealousy for Mr. Nicholson, who disapproves of Alan's influence on his son. Despite his father's disapproval, John continues to see Alan secretly. One Saturday, John is entrusted with four hundred pounds to deposit in the bank but is sidetracked by a visit to Alan at a billiard room. Alan persuades John to pawn his watch to lend him money, leading to a series of unfortunate events, including the bank closing before John can deposit the money.

As the day unfolds, John encounters Flora Mackenzie, a girl he admires, and escorts her home, feeling a mixture of hope and inadequacy. Later, he is drawn into a social gathering at Colette’s, an unlicensed supper house, where he and his friends are caught by the police. This incident adds to John's growing list of troubles.

The following morning, John confesses to his father about the missing money and the pawned watch, only to be overwhelmed by his father's disappointment and anger. In a moment of desperation, John steals money from his father's drawer and leaves a farewell note before fleeing Edinburgh, intent on starting anew in California.

John's journey to California is fraught with hardship; he is rooked, robbed, and beaten. Eventually, he finds work in a bank in San Francisco, where he unexpectedly amasses a small fortune through stock investments. Despite his newfound wealth, John struggles with guilt over his past actions and his failure to communicate with his family.

Ten years later, John decides to return to Edinburgh for Christmas, hoping for reconciliation. However, his homecoming is fraught with misunderstandings and the fear of being accused of embezzlement. He learns that his father has been informed of his alleged crimes in California, but a friend of Mr. Nicholson's, Macewen, agrees to cover the supposed debt to prevent scandal.

In Edinburgh, John experiences a series of humiliating encounters, culminating in a return to his father's house, where he is initially rejected. However, with the help of his brother Alexander and Flora, who is now a nurse, John begins to make amends. A cablegram to San Francisco clears John's name, revealing that his colleague Kirkman was responsible for the theft.

Reunited with his family, John marries Flora, and they settle into a new life together. Despite the rocky start, John's return to Edinburgh marks a new beginning, with the past misadventures serving as lessons learned. The story concludes with John and Flora attending a dinner party, where Flora's management of John's smoking habits reflects their harmonious relationship.
