This fact connects the children's discovery of shelter with their eventual rescue, showing how the cabin played a crucial role in their survival and reunion with their parents.","This corrupted fact contradicts the information in both chapters, which describe an old, empty cabin or hut rather than a modern lighthouse, and the children hear the search party rather than signaling them.","Chapter 19, 20","- Chapter 19, item 3: Freddie spots a building, which turns out to be an old, empty cabin near the shore of the lake.
- Chapter 20, item 7: The Bobbsey twins reunite with their parents, explaining they heard talking and came out of the hut.
- Relationship: The cabin/hut serves as shelter for the children and the location of their reunion with their parents.",Unique,Valid claim
