In New York, a significant shift is occurring in the world of journalism, unbeknownst to the general public. The editor-in-chief of _Cosy Moments_, Mr. J. Fillken Wilberfloss, is about to take a ten-week vacation, leaving the paper in the hands of his sub-editor, Billy Windsor. _Cosy Moments_ is a home journal, known for its mild and domestic content, but Billy Windsor, a Wyoming-born, tough and ambitious young man, is not content with the paper's current state. He dreams of making a name for himself in the competitive world of New York journalism.

Billy Windsor's life changes when he meets Psmith, a charismatic and eloquent young man from England who is visiting New York with his friend Mike Jackson. Psmith, seeking excitement and a break from the monotony of his previous life, decides to join Billy in revamping _Cosy Moments_. They plan to transform it from a dull family magazine into a vibrant, hard-hitting journal that tackles pressing social issues.

Their first target is the deplorable conditions in the Pleasant Street tenements, owned by a mysterious and unscrupulous landlord. Psmith and Billy decide to use the paper to expose these conditions and bring about change. This decision, however, puts them in the crosshairs of powerful and dangerous figures who want to keep the status quo.

As they begin their campaign, they encounter various challenges, including threats from gang members and the complexities of uncovering the identity of the tenements' owner. Psmith's wit and Billy's determination drive them forward, and they enlist the help of Bat Jarvis, a local gang leader and cat enthusiast, who becomes an unlikely ally.

Amidst these developments, Billy Windsor is arrested and sentenced to a short jail term for hitting a policeman, leaving Psmith to handle the paper's affairs alone. Psmith's ingenuity and charm enable him to navigate these challenges, even as he deals with disgruntled former contributors and the editorial staff's skepticism.

Psmith's efforts to revitalize _Cosy Moments_ include introducing a sports section featuring Kid Brady, a promising young boxer from Wyoming, whom they decide to promote through the paper. This move, along with their investigative reporting on the tenements, begins to attract attention and increase the paper's circulation.

The turning point comes when Psmith receives a note from Billy, who has escaped from jail, asking for help. However, this turns out to be a trap set by their adversaries. Psmith is kidnapped but manages to escape with the help of Kid Brady, who happens to be nearby.

The climax of their campaign occurs when Psmith confronts Stewart Waring, the corrupt owner of the tenements, and forces him to pay for improvements to the buildings by threatening to expose his misdeeds. With this victory, Psmith and Billy Windsor successfully transform _Cosy Moments_ into a respected and influential publication, achieving their goal of making a real impact in New York journalism.

In the end, Psmith reflects on the success of their venture and the unexpected alliances they formed along the way. Despite the challenges, they have managed to turn _Cosy Moments_ into a paper that stands up for the people's rights, fulfilling their vision of a vibrant and socially conscious journal.
