One morning, Gregor Samsa, a traveling salesman, awakens to find himself transformed into a grotesque insect. His initial shock is compounded by the realization that he is late for work. Gregor's room, filled with familiar objects, now feels alien as he struggles to adapt to his new form. Despite his predicament, Gregor's primary concern is the impact his absence will have on his job, which he holds to pay off his family's debt. His family—his gentle mother, his authoritative father, and his caring sister, Grete—are unaware of his transformation and attempt to interact with him through his locked bedroom door.

As the morning unfolds, Gregor's family grows anxious about his absence. The chief clerk from his office arrives to inquire about Gregor's tardiness, further escalating the tension. Gregor, in a panic, attempts to communicate but only produces incomprehensible sounds. His desperate attempts to open the door result in a struggle that leaves him exhausted and exposed to his horrified family and the clerk. The sight of Gregor's transformed body sends his mother into a faint and prompts his father to drive him back into his room with a stick, injuring him in the process.

Over the following days, the Samsa family grapples with the implications of Gregor's transformation. Grete takes on the responsibility of caring for Gregor, initially showing compassion by bringing him food and cleaning his room. However, as time passes, the family's patience wanes. The burden of Gregor's condition strains their finances and relationships. Gregor overhears conversations about their financial struggles, learning that his father has been secretly saving money. This revelation brings Gregor a brief sense of relief, knowing that his family might survive without his income.

Gregor's isolation deepens as his family becomes increasingly distant. His once-close bond with Grete deteriorates as she grows weary of her duties. Gregor's mother, initially eager to see him, is kept at bay by his father and sister, who fear the emotional toll it might take on her. In a misguided attempt to give Gregor more space, Grete and their mother remove furniture from his room, stripping it of its human comforts. This act, though well-intentioned, leaves Gregor feeling more alienated and desperate to hold onto the remnants of his former life.

As the family's situation worsens, they take in lodgers to make ends meet. The presence of these boarders further marginalizes Gregor, who is confined to his room, surrounded by clutter and neglect. One evening, Grete plays the violin for the lodgers, and Gregor, drawn by the music, ventures into the living room. His appearance terrifies the lodgers, leading them to terminate their stay abruptly. This incident becomes a turning point for the Samsa family, who, overwhelmed by shame and frustration, decide that Gregor must be removed.

In a heated discussion, Grete insists that they must rid themselves of the creature that Gregor has become, arguing that it is no longer her brother. Her words devastate Gregor, who retreats to his room, feeling the weight of his family's rejection. Exhausted and wounded, both physically and emotionally, Gregor succumbs to his injuries and dies alone in his room.

The following morning, the family's charwoman discovers Gregor's lifeless body and informs the Samsas. The family experiences a mix of relief and sorrow, recognizing that their burden has been lifted but also mourning the loss of their son and brother. They begin to contemplate their future, realizing that they can now move forward without the shadow of Gregor's condition looming over them.

In the days that follow, the Samsa family decides to leave their current apartment for a smaller, more affordable one, symbolizing a fresh start. As they travel together on a tram, they discuss their prospects and find hope in the opportunities that lie ahead. Grete, in particular, is seen as blossoming into a young woman with a promising future, and her parents begin to consider the possibility of finding her a suitable husband. The family's renewed optimism marks the end of their ordeal, as they look forward to rebuilding their lives.
