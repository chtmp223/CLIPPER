In the early 20th century, Avis Everhard reflects on her transformative journey from a sheltered academic environment to becoming a key figure in a revolutionary movement. Her transition begins when she meets Ernest Everhard, a charismatic and radical socialist leader, who challenges her understanding of society and exposes her to the harsh realities faced by the working class. Ernest's influence is profound, and Avis finds herself drawn to his passionate ideals and eventually falls in love with him.

Ernest, a former laborer turned intellectual, is deeply involved in the socialist movement, advocating for the rights of the proletariat against the oppressive capitalist system. He is a powerful orator, capable of captivating and unsettling audiences with his incisive critiques of capitalism. Avis's father, a university professor, invites Ernest to their home, where he debates with other intellectuals and exposes the moral and ethical failings of the ruling class. Through these interactions, Avis becomes increasingly aware of the injustices perpetuated by the capitalist system, particularly after investigating the case of Jackson, a worker who lost his arm in an industrial accident and received no compensation.

As Avis becomes more involved in the movement, she witnesses the growing tensions between the working class and the oligarchs, the wealthy elite who control the means of production and the government. The oligarchs, fearing the rise of socialism, begin to tighten their grip on power, using the military and legal systems to suppress dissent. Ernest, aware of the impending conflict, prepares for a revolution, believing that the only way to achieve true equality is through the overthrow of the capitalist system.

The narrative unfolds against the backdrop of a rapidly changing society, where the oligarchs consolidate their power through trusts and monopolies, squeezing out small business owners and exacerbating the divide between the rich and the poor. The middle class, caught between the oligarchs and the proletariat, struggles to maintain its position, but ultimately faces a decline as the forces of capitalism and socialism clash.

Avis and Ernest's relationship deepens as they navigate the challenges of their revolutionary work. They marry and continue to fight for the cause, even as the threat of violence and repression looms large. The revolution gains momentum, with strikes and uprisings occurring across the country, but the oligarchs respond with brutal force, using the military to crush the insurgents.

Throughout the narrative, Avis grapples with her own beliefs and the implications of the revolution. She witnesses the sacrifices made by her comrades, the harsh realities of life for the working class, and the moral complexities of the struggle for justice. Despite the setbacks and the personal risks, Avis remains committed to the cause, inspired by Ernest's unwavering dedication and the vision of a more equitable society.

The story culminates in the Chicago Commune, a failed uprising that results in widespread destruction and loss of life. The revolutionaries are defeated, but the struggle continues, as the seeds of change have been sown. Avis reflects on the events and the lessons learned, recognizing the enduring power of the human spirit and the inevitability of social evolution.

Through Avis's eyes, the narrative explores themes of power, justice, and the relentless pursuit of equality. It is a poignant and thought-provoking examination of the social and economic forces that shape human history and the enduring struggle for a better world.
