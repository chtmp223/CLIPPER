The narrative unfolds with a group of children on Prince Edward Island, exploring their adventures, relationships, and the passage of time. The story is set in the early 20th century and revolves around the King family and their friends, including the Story Girl, Sara Stanley, and Peter Craig, among others.

The children engage in various activities, such as creating their own magazine, "Our Magazine," where they contribute stories, editorials, and personal anecdotes. The magazine becomes a central part of their lives, offering them a platform to express their creativity and document their experiences. Each child contributes in their way, with Peter attempting to write fiction, Felicity managing the household department, and Cecily contributing fashion notes.

Throughout the narrative, the children face typical challenges of growing up, such as dealing with family expectations, navigating friendships, and confronting fears. They also encounter more extraordinary events, like being caught in a snowstorm and taking refuge with the mysterious Peg Bowen, rumored to be a witch. This encounter leaves them with a mix of fear and fascination, as Peg's peculiar lifestyle and cryptic predictions linger in their minds.

The children's interactions with adults, such as the visit from the Governor's wife, whom they mistakenly believe to be their Great-aunt Eliza, provide moments of humor and misunderstanding. These interactions highlight the children's innocence and the sometimes comical gap between their perceptions and reality.

As the seasons change, the children experience significant life events, such as the departure of the Story Girl and the return of Beverley and Felix's father, signaling the end of their stay on the island. These departures mark the end of an era for the group, as they are forced to confront the inevitability of change and the bittersweet nature of growing up.

The narrative captures the essence of childhood with its mix of imagination, adventure, and the gradual realization of adult responsibilities. The children's resolutions, their magazine, and their adventures serve as a microcosm of their journey from innocence to experience, set against the backdrop of the idyllic yet challenging rural life on Prince Edward Island. The story concludes with a sense of nostalgia and the acknowledgment that while the golden days of childhood may end, the memories and friendships forged during this time will endure.
