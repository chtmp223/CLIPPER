In the early chapters, Claire Robson attends a Red Cross concert at the Second Presbyterian Church in San Francisco, where she encounters a Serbian speaker whose passionate plea for his country captivates her. Claire, a young woman struggling with a sense of isolation and indifference from her church community, is accompanied by her mother, Mrs. Robson, who is more concerned with social appearances than Claire's growing internal conflict.

After the concert, Claire and her mother find themselves awkwardly seated at a table with prominent church members, including Mrs. Towne, who later asks them to move. This social snub is mitigated when Ned Stillman, a man of social standing, invites them to join his table, along with Mrs. Condor, a singer at the concert. Claire is intrigued by Stillman and finds herself drawn into a world that seems both enticing and beyond her reach.

As the narrative unfolds, Claire's life is marked by a series of social and personal challenges. Her mother, Mrs. Robson, clings to memories of a more prosperous past, while Claire navigates the complexities of working at the Falcon Insurance Company under the lecherous Mr. Flint. Claire's promotion to stenographer-in-chief comes at the cost of Nellie Whitehead's dismissal, highlighting the precarious nature of her position.

Claire's encounter with Stillman at a church social and subsequent invitation to a musical evening at his apartments with Mrs. Condor marks a turning point. She experiences a night of unexpected freedom and social acceptance, dancing at the Palace Hotel with Phil Edington, a young man from Stillman's circle. This experience is both exhilarating and unsettling, as Claire grapples with the implications of her newfound social mobility.

However, the excitement is short-lived as Claire faces the harsh realities of her mother's illness. Mrs. Robson suffers a stroke, leaving Claire to manage the household and her mother's care. The arrival of Claire's aunts, Mrs. Thomas Wynne and Mrs. Edward Ffinch-Brown, brings little comfort, as they are more concerned with appearances than genuine support.

Claire's situation becomes more precarious when she loses her job at the insurance company, a consequence of her entanglement with Stillman and the gossip it generates. Stillman, meanwhile, is caught between his sense of loyalty to Flint, a former friend, and his growing concern for Claire's welfare. He contemplates ways to help her, including a plan involving Lily Condor, who suggests hiring Claire as an accompanist.

The narrative explores themes of social class, isolation, and the struggle for independence. Claire's journey is one of self-discovery, as she confronts the limitations imposed by her circumstances and the expectations of those around her. Her interactions with Stillman and Mrs. Condor offer glimpses of a world beyond her reach, while her mother's illness and her dismissal from work force her to reassess her priorities and seek a path forward.

As the story progresses, Claire must navigate the challenges of her new reality, balancing her responsibilities at home with the need to secure her future. The support of friends like Nellie Whitehead provides moments of relief, but the overarching narrative is one of resilience in the face of adversity. Claire's story is one of growth and transformation, as she learns to assert her independence and find her place in a world that often seems indifferent to her struggles.
