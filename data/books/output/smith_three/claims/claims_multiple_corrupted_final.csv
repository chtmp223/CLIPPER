   b. ""include visiplates"": The chapter outline does not explicitly mention visiplates as part of the instruments shown by Dunark. However, visiplates are mentioned in Chapter 4, event 2, where the Skylark crew uses them to observe an unknown spacecraft.
   c. ""which are later used by the Skylark crew to observe an unknown spacecraft when alerted by an alarm"": This part is grounded in Chapter 4, events 2 and 3, where an alarm alerts the crew to an unknown spacecraft, and they use visiplates to observe it.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not explicitly stated in the chapter outline. While visiplates are used by the Skylark crew, there is no direct evidence in the outline that they were part of the instruments shown by Dunark.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation, as it assumes that the visiplates used by the Skylark crew were the same as those shown by Dunark, which is not explicitly stated.
   c. The relationship does not contradict any information in the summary or outline, but it lacks explicit grounding.

Since 1b. and 2a. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."

- Relationship: Detection methods for Fenachrone",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of each atomic part:
   a. DuQuesne's group uses advanced detection methods to locate Fenachrone in space: This part is grounded in Chapter 7, where DuQuesne and Loring detect energy emissions to find a Fenachrone survivor.
   b. Seaton's crew uses an ultra-detector to locate the Fenachrone vessel: This part is grounded in Chapter 15, where the Skylark Three crew detects the Fenachrone vessel using an ultra-detector.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful, as both groups use advanced detection methods to locate Fenachrone-related targets in space.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outlines.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as both groups are involved in interstellar exploration and conflict with the Fenachrone.

Seaton's offensive capabilities against Fenachrone vessels evolve from using a zone of force to destroy a single ship to employing a concentrated energy field from Skylark Three to completely destroy the Fenachrone vessel.,Seaton's offensive capabilities against Fenachrone vessels evolve from using a concentrated energy field to destroy a single ship to employing a zone of force from Skylark Three to completely destroy the Fenachrone vessel.,"In Chapter 5, Seaton uses a zone of force to destroy a Fenachrone ship. Later, in Chapter 15, Seaton's capabilities have advanced to the point where Skylark Three can generate a concentrated energy field powerful enough to completely destroy the Fenachrone vessel. This demonstrates the progression of Seaton's offensive technology throughout the story.","The corrupted fact reverses the order of technological advancement, which contradicts the information provided in the chapter outlines.","Chapter 5, 15","- Chapter 5, item 1: Seaton uses a zone of force to destroy the Fenachrone ship and captures its captain aboard the Skylark.
