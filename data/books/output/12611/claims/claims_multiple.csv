2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The claim connects Edward Henry's financial gain from the rubber shares speculation to his impulsive decision to invest in the theatre option, which is a logical sequence of events.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly grounded in the chapter outline.

    c. The relationship does not contradict the overall narrative in the book summary, but the specific detail of the amount spent is inconsistent with the chapter outline.

Since the claim contains an incorrect detail regarding the amount spent, it is not fully grounded in the chapter outline, making the claim INVALID."
