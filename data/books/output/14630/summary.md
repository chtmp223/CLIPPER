Ruth Fielding and her friends are back at Briarwood Hall for another term, filled with the usual excitement and challenges. The story begins with the aftermath of a train wreck at Applegate Crossing, where Ruth and her friends encounter Jerry Sheming, a young man with a strained leg who had heroically saved Jane Ann Hicks from a derailed train car. Jerry is taken to the Red Mill, where Ruth lives with her Aunt Alvirah and Uncle Jabez, for recovery. Ruth learns about Jerry's past, including his life on Cliff Island with his half-crazed uncle, Peter Tilton, who had been committed to an asylum after a dispute with a real estate man named Rufus Blent over the ownership of the island.

As the term at Briarwood begins, Ruth, Helen Cameron, and their friends are eager to settle into their studies and social activities. Ann Hicks, the new girl from Silver Ranch, struggles to fit in due to her lack of academic preparation and her Western ways, which make her a target for teasing by some of the other girls. Despite this, Ann shows her worth by saving a group of girls from a drifting punt at a picnic by expertly throwing a rope to them, an act that begins to change her reputation among her peers.

Ruth is intrigued by Jerry's story of the lost treasure box on Cliff Island, which supposedly contains money and papers proving his uncle's ownership of part of the island. She is determined to help Jerry and sees an opportunity when Belle Tingley invites her and her friends to Cliff Island for the Christmas holidays. Ruth arranges for Jerry to be employed by Belle's father, who has bought the island, so that Jerry can continue his search for the treasure box.

As the term progresses, Ann Hicks gradually finds her place at Briarwood, thanks to Ruth and her friends' support, and her own efforts to engage with her studies and the other girls. Ruth's determination to help Jerry and her kindness towards Ann highlight her character's compassion and resourcefulness. The story sets the stage for the upcoming adventure on Cliff Island, where the mystery of the treasure box and Jerry's quest for justice will unfold.
