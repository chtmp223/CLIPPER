In Chapter 3, Rouletabille theorizes about the murderer's escape route through the vestibule window. In Chapter 11, Larsan presents his theory on how the murderer escaped from The Yellow Room when only Professor Stangerson was present.
   b. ""Rouletabille focusing on the vestibule window"": This part is explicitly mentioned in Chapter 3, where Rouletabille theorizes about the escape route through the vestibule window.
   c. ""Larsan proposing an escape when only Professor Stangerson was present"": This part is grounded in Chapter 11, where Larsan explains his theory on the murderer's escape when only Professor Stangerson was present.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful, as it highlights the differing theories of Rouletabille and Larsan regarding the escape route, which is a central aspect of the investigation.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outlines.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it aligns with the investigative process and the development of different theories by the characters.
