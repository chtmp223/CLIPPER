The arrival of Innocent Smith, a charismatic and seemingly eccentric man, disrupts their mundane lives. Smith's actions, such as firing a pistol in the garden and climbing trees, lead to a series of accusations and a makeshift trial to determine his guilt or innocence.

Dr. Cyrus Pym, an American criminologist, and Moses Gould, a lively and somewhat cynical character, represent the prosecution. They present evidence and testimonies from various individuals who claim to have encountered Smith under suspicious circumstances. These accounts depict Smith as a man who has engaged in multiple marriages and mysterious escapades across the globe, raising questions about his sanity and intentions.
