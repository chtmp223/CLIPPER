   b. ""Tom Swift develops a theory about artificial shock waves causing earthquakes"": This part is grounded in Chapter 8, event 1, where Tom develops a theory about artificial shock waves causing earthquakes.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is meaningful and valid. The experience of the tidal wave and the subsequent information about the earthquake's impact likely contribute to Tom's development of a theory about artificial shock waves. The sequence of events suggests a logical progression from experiencing the effects of an earthquake to theorizing about its artificial nature.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is a logical inference based on the sequence of events described in the chapter outline.
