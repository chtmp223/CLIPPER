In the novel, the story unfolds at Belpher Castle in Hampshire, home to the Marshmoreton family. The current Earl, Lord Marshmoreton, is a widower with two children: Percy Wilbraham Marsh, Lord Belpher, and Lady Patricia Maud Marsh. The castle is managed by Lady Caroline Byng, Lord Marshmoreton's sister, who is determined to manage the family's affairs, including Maud's marital prospects.

The plot thickens when George Bevan, a successful American composer, becomes infatuated with Lady Maud after a chance encounter in a taxi in London. Maud, however, is entangled in a romantic affair with Geoffrey Raymond, a man her family disapproves of due to his lack of wealth and title. The family, particularly Lady Caroline and Percy, are intent on Maud marrying someone of higher social standing, like Reggie Byng, Lady Caroline's stepson.

George, determined to win Maud's love, moves to a cottage near Belpher Castle to be closer to her. Meanwhile, Maud is confined to the castle under the watchful eyes of her family, who are unaware of her secret love for Geoffrey. Despite the odds, George becomes a confidant and ally to Maud, offering to help her communicate with Geoffrey. However, Maud's feelings become conflicted as she grows fond of George's kindness and support.

The narrative is further complicated by various comedic and romantic entanglements involving the castle's staff and visitors. Billie Dore, a chorus girl and friend of George, provides comic relief and assists in the unfolding drama.

The climax builds as Lord Marshmoreton inadvertently announces Maud's engagement to George during a dinner party, believing it to be a strategic move to resolve the family's issues. This announcement throws George into a whirlwind of emotions, as he realizes the depth of his feelings for Maud.

Ultimately, the story resolves with Maud recognizing her true feelings for George, deciding to break free from her family's constraints and societal expectations. The novel concludes with a comedic twist, highlighting the themes of love, societal pressures, and the pursuit of happiness against all odds.
