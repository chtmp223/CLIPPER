2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. Ruth's financial difficulty regarding the costume is directly resolved by her decision to use the reward money, which is a logical and coherent progression of events.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as Ruth's financial constraints and her subsequent financial independence are central themes in the narrative.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. Ruth's initial difficulty in affording a new costume for the mid-winter exhibition: This part is grounded in Chapter 22, where Ruth is in a difficult position because the class decides to wear new costumes, and she struggles with the decision of whether to use her saved money for the costume.
    b. Ruth borrows money from Helen to purchase the gymnasium costume: This part is not grounded in either the book summary or the chapter outline. There is no mention of Ruth borrowing money from Helen. Instead, Chapter 25 indicates that Ruth decides to use some of the reward money to purchase a new gymnasium costume.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not valid because the claim that Ruth borrows money from Helen is not supported by the provided information.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the resolution of Ruth's difficulty is through the reward money, not borrowing from Helen.

Since 1b. and 2a. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
