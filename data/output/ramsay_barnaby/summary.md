In a desolate town called Paradise, the M'Kune Tragedy Company finds itself stranded, performing night after night in a shingle hut to a dwindling audience. The town, a forsaken relic of civilization, is enveloped in despair, with its trees burned for firewood and its earth fruitlessly mined for gold. The company, trapped and penniless, is desperate to earn enough to escape, and their performances take on a frantic intensity as they try to captivate Paradise’s residents.

Among the company is a young actress who, after a particularly grueling performance, collapses from exhaustion. While her fellow actors celebrate their successful escape, she is left behind, too weak to join them. As she lies alone, a fellow actress visits her, offering a startling proposition. The visitor, who reveals herself to be the widow of an Englishman, John Barnabas Hill, suggests that the young actress assume her identity. She provides a ring and papers, urging the girl to take her place and be cared for by Hill’s family in England.

The young actress, now assuming the identity of Susan, finds herself in England, where she is taken in by Lady Henrietta, Barnaby's mother. Lady Henrietta, unaware of the deception, believes Susan to be her son’s widow. Barnaby, presumed dead, had left behind a complicated legacy, including a supposed marriage to the American Susan.

However, Barnaby is not dead. He returns unexpectedly, causing chaos and confusion. Susan, caught in her deception, is terrified of the consequences. Yet, Barnaby, upon discovering the truth, decides to maintain the pretense to protect his mother from the shock and to avoid scandal. He proposes that they continue the charade, treating each other with respect while they figure out a plan.

As Susan navigates her new life, she grows closer to Barnaby, who is kind and understanding. Despite their arrangement, there is an undercurrent of tension, particularly with the presence of Julia, Barnaby's former love. Julia, who had once hoped to marry Barnaby, is suspicious of Susan and seeks to uncover the truth.

Barnaby and Susan’s relationship deepens as they spend time together, sharing moments of genuine connection amidst the farce. Susan, who once felt like an impostor, begins to find a sense of belonging and safety in Barnaby’s world. She participates in the social life of the community, even riding in hunts and attending balls, where her charm and spirit win over many of Barnaby’s friends.

However, Rackham, Barnaby’s cousin, harbors feelings for Susan and becomes a threat to their fragile arrangement. He confronts Susan, declaring his love and urging her to leave Barnaby for him. Susan, loyal to Barnaby and their agreement, refuses Rackham, despite his persistence.

As the pressure mounts, Barnaby decides it is time to end the deception. He plans for Susan to receive a telegram calling her back to America, providing a plausible excuse for her departure. Yet, as the moment of farewell approaches, both Barnaby and Susan are reluctant to part ways. Their fabricated relationship has grown into something real, filled with mutual respect and unspoken affection.

In the end, Barnaby and Susan must confront their true feelings. The story concludes with the acknowledgment that their pretend marriage has developed into a genuine bond, leaving them to decide whether to continue their lives together or apart. Through humor, tension, and heartfelt moments, the narrative explores themes of identity, love, and the power of deception to reveal deeper truths.
