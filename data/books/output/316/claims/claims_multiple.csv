""similar to how the children whisper to their guest to accommodate her perceived sensitivity to loud noises"": This part is grounded in event 4 of Chapter 6, where the children discuss family stories, unaware that their guest can hear everything. The outline does not mention whispering; instead, it mentions shouting to accommodate her perceived deafness.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid or meaningful. The claim attempts to draw a parallel between two unrelated events: Ursula being locked in her room and the children's behavior towards their guest. The situations are different in nature and context.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the two events are not connected or similar in any meaningful way.

Since 1a., 1b., 2a., and 2b. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
