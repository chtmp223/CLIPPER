In a quaint, old house that had been closed for years, young Bab and Betty, two lively sisters, discover a mysterious dog that seems to be haunting the place. The girls, along with their mother, Mrs. Moss, soon learn that the dog is connected to a runaway boy named Ben Brown. Ben, a circus boy with a talent for riding and performing tricks, has been living in the abandoned coach-house with the dog, Sancho. He ran away from an abusive circus life after his father disappeared, leaving him to fend for himself.

Mrs. Moss, touched by Ben's plight, takes him in, offering him food, shelter, and kindness. Ben becomes friends with Bab and Betty, and they share their books and stories with him, teaching him to read and write. The Squire, a local gentleman, offers Ben work on his farm, which he accepts, hoping to make a new life for himself while waiting for his father to return.

Miss Celia, a kind and wealthy young woman, moves into the old house with her brother Thorny, who is recovering from an illness. She takes a liking to Ben and offers him a job to help take care of Thorny and the animals. Ben eagerly accepts, and a friendship blossoms between the children. Miss Celia, understanding Ben's love for animals, entrusts him with the care of her pets, including a beautiful horse named Lita.

Throughout the summer, Ben learns many things, not only from books but also from the people around him. Miss Celia becomes a motherly figure, providing guidance and affection, while Thorny, initially aloof, warms up to Ben, finding in him a companion who shares his interests.

As the story unfolds, the children enjoy various adventures, including archery contests, picnics, and theatrical performances. Ben's loyalty and bravery shine through when he saves Miss Celia's home from a fire, solidifying his place in the community. The mystery of Sancho's disappearance is solved when he is found and returned, bringing joy to all, especially Ben.

The story concludes with a heartwarming reunion when Ben's father, thought to be dead, returns. He had been injured and lost contact with Ben but is now back to take care of his son. The community welcomes him, and Ben's future looks bright. Miss Celia plans to stay in the town, and the great gate of the old house is opened, symbolizing a new beginning for all. The tale ends with a sense of belonging and hope as Ben, Bab, Betty, and their friends look forward to more happy times together under the lilacs.
