This warning is later confirmed in Chapter 21, where the cones are described as shooting a column of light towards the sun. As this occurs, the City's energy appears to drain, with structures sagging and dimming. This sequence of events supports Ventnor's earlier warning about the metal beings' relationship with the sun as their power source.","This corrupted fact incorrectly states that the metal beings draw power from the moon instead of the sun, and that this causes the City's energy to increase rather than drain. These details contradict the information provided in the outline.","Chapter 13, 21","- Chapter 13, item 5: Ventnor warns about metal beings with crystal brains that draw power from the sun, identifying the sun as their potential weakness.
