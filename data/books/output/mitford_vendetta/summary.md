Kenrick Holt, a reticent and solitary man, finds himself unexpectedly on a voyage to South Africa after a boating accident leads to his rescue by the steamer *Kittiwake*. During the journey, he befriends the ship's captain, John Morrissey, and the crew, who show him kindness and camaraderie. Upon arriving at the port of East London, Kenrick is initially stranded with limited resources and no acquaintances. However, a chance encounter with Brian Matterson, an old schoolmate, changes his fate.

Brian, recognizing Kenrick's name from a bank card, offers him hospitality at his family's farm. Kenrick is introduced to the Matterson family, including Brian's sister Beryl, a capable and attractive woman, and their younger siblings Iris and George. Beryl's initial reserve and Brian's warm welcome make Kenrick feel at home, and he quickly becomes involved in the daily life and challenges of the farm.

The Mattersons are stock farmers living on the frontier, surrounded by a large population of Kafirs, who are often at odds with the settlers. Kenrick witnesses the complexities and tensions of living among the native tribes, especially when a confrontation occurs between Brian and a Kafir named Sibuko. Despite this, the family maintains a philosophy of understanding and mutual respect, though they are always prepared to defend themselves.

Kenrick's time at the farm is marked by new experiences, including hunting expeditions and the development of a close friendship with Brian and a growing attraction to Beryl. However, the tranquility is shattered when George accidentally kills two Kafir boys, leading to a tense standoff with the local tribe. The situation is diffused by the intervention of a local chief, Usivulele, who helps negotiate peace.

The tragedy leaves a lasting impact on the family, and Kenrick becomes even more integrated into their lives. He contemplates starting a new life in South Africa, buoyed by his growing affection for Beryl. His feelings are complicated by the arrival of Dr. Pentridge, a charming and eligible suitor for Beryl, who also takes an interest in her.

As Kenrick struggles with his emotions and the revelation of his financial ruin due to a mishap back in England, he finds himself at a crossroads. Beryl, perceptive and understanding, becomes aware of his inner turmoil and offers her support, leading to a deepening of their bond.

The story reaches a dramatic climax when Kenrick and Beryl embark on a desperate night ride to rescue Septimus Matterson and George, who are feared to be in danger. They discover the tragic murder of both, a vendetta carried out by the Kafirs in retaliation for the earlier deaths. In a moment of intense resolve, Beryl captures the chief Kuliso, intending to exact personal justice, but is stopped by Kenrick's intervention and the arrival of Brian and the police.

In the aftermath, Kenrick and Beryl's relationship solidifies, and they find solace in each other amid the grief. The story concludes with Kenrick finding his place within the family and the farm, as he and Beryl plan a future together, overcoming the shadows of the past with hope and resilience.
