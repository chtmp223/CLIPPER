In the opening chapter, a young man, recently returned from the war in France, struggles to reintegrate into civilian life. His family, including his affectionate mother and father, welcome him home warmly, but he feels disconnected from the peace and routine of civilian life. Haunted by his wartime experiences, he finds himself out of sync with those who did not share in the horrors of combat. His mother, noticing his restlessness, orchestrates a secret plan with his father and other family members to help him find peace and diversion.

They propose a cruise on the family yacht, the _Whim_, to seek adventure and romance. Although initially reluctant, the young man agrees to the plan, buoyed by the idea of inviting his war buddy, Tommy Davis, to join him. The prospect of a cruise offers a glimmer of hope to reconnect with life beyond the trauma of war.

As the story progresses, the young man and Tommy set sail, only to be caught in a storm that tests their resolve. They encounter a mysterious yacht, the _Orchid_, and a series of strange events unfold, including a failed attempt to bomb their vessel. The young man becomes increasingly drawn to a captivating and enigmatic girl, Sylvia, whom he first glimpses in a Havana caf√©. She is in peril, embroiled in a web of deceit and danger involving counterfeiters and a missing princess from Azuria, a small European kingdom.

As the young man, Tommy, and their newfound ally, the eccentric but brilliant Professor Dragot, pursue the _Orchid_ and its secrets, they uncover a plot involving Sylvia's true identity as the kidnapped princess of Azuria. The narrative weaves through dreams, visions, and real dangers as they chase the yacht across the Gulf of Mexico, determined to rescue Sylvia from her captors and uncover the truth.

The young man's journey is as much about self-discovery and healing as it is about the physical quest for Sylvia. His love for her grows, intertwined with the adventure and the realization that his wartime experiences have prepared him to face the challenges of this new quest. The story explores themes of love, duty, and the search for meaning in a world that has been irrevocably changed by war.

The novel concludes with the young man and his allies confronting the villains, securing Sylvia's safety, and contemplating the future. The resolution is both a personal triumph for the young man and a fulfillment of his promise to seek adventure and romance, bringing him closer to healing the wounds of his past.
