Georges Duroy, a former soldier struggling to make ends meet in Paris, finds himself with only three francs to last the month. He encounters an old comrade, Charles Forestier, who introduces him to the world of journalism and Parisian society. Duroy is captivated by Forestier's wife, Madeleine, and the sophisticated lifestyle they lead. He is soon hired by M. Walter, the manager of "La Vie Francaise," and begins his ascent in the world of journalism.

Duroy becomes entangled with several women, including Mme. de Marelle, with whom he has an affair. He also grows closer to Madeleine Forestier, who helps him with his writing and provides him with valuable connections. When Forestier falls ill and later dies, Duroy seizes the opportunity to propose to Madeleine, who accepts under the condition that their marriage will be a partnership of equals.

As Duroy's career flourishes, he becomes more ambitious and ruthless. He changes his name to Du Roy de Cantel, a more aristocratic-sounding name, to fit his new social standing. He marries Madeleine, but their relationship is strained by his infidelities and her independence. Duroy continues his affair with Mme. de Marelle and becomes involved with Mme. Walter, the wife of his boss, who is infatuated with him.

Duroy's ambition leads him to orchestrate a scandal that forces a rival, Laroche-Mathieu, out of power, further securing his position at the newspaper. He also manipulates his way into marrying Suzanne Walter, M. Walter's daughter, by eloping with her and forcing the family to consent to the marriage to avoid scandal. This marriage solidifies his status and wealth.

Throughout the novel, Duroy is depicted as a man driven by ambition and a desire for wealth and power, willing to manipulate and betray those around him to achieve his goals. His rise in Parisian society is marked by his cunning, charm, and ability to exploit the weaknesses of others, particularly women. The story ends with Duroy feeling triumphant, having secured a prominent position and a wealthy wife, but it leaves open the question of whether his relentless pursuit of success has truly brought him happiness.
