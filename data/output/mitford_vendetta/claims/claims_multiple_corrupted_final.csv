The worsening weather conditions that prevented Captain Morrissey from putting Holt ashore were likely a continuation of the thick fog that had initially caused Holt to become lost at sea.,The clear weather conditions that prevented Captain Morrissey from putting Holt ashore were a stark contrast to the thick fog that had initially caused Holt to become lost at sea.,"In Chapter 1, Holt spends hours adrift in thick fog, narrowly avoiding collisions with passing ships.
