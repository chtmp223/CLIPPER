Instead, they depict her as a strong and resilient woman who is determined to care for her husband despite his condition.
   b. ""she leaves the surgical preparations early"": This part is grounded in event 5 of Chapter 1, where a nurse directs her to wait in the office, which does not necessarily indicate indifference.

The term ""reluctantly"" is not explicitly stated in the outline or summary and is a subjective interpretation.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid or meaningful. The claim suggests indifference based on actions that are not clearly indicative of such feelings. The summary and outline portray Mrs. Preston as compassionate and dutiful, which contradicts the claim of indifference.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as they emphasize Mrs. Preston's dedication and compassion rather than indifference.
