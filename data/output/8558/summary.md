The story begins with Gervaise, a laundress living in Paris, who is waiting for her partner, Lantier, to return home. She is heartbroken when she realizes he has left her for another woman, Adele. Despite the betrayal, Gervaise remains determined to support herself and her two children, Claude and Etienne, and dreams of a better life.

Gervaise meets Coupeau, a roofer, who falls in love with her. Despite her initial reluctance due to her previous experience with Lantier, Gervaise eventually agrees to marry Coupeau. The couple enjoys a happy life at first, with Gervaise opening her own laundry shop and Coupeau working steadily. They have a daughter, Nana, and the family seems content.

However, Coupeau suffers a serious accident at work, which leaves him unable to return to his job. During his recovery, he begins to drink heavily, and his behavior becomes erratic and abusive. Gervaise, despite her hard work and attempts to keep the family afloat, struggles to manage the household and pay off debts.

Lantier reappears in Gervaise's life and moves in with the family, creating tension and complicating her relationship with Coupeau. Gervaise's business starts to decline due to her inability to manage her finances and the increasing chaos in her personal life. Her reputation in the neighborhood suffers, and she becomes the subject of gossip.

As Coupeau's drinking worsens, Gervaise finds herself drawn back into a relationship with Lantier. Over time, her dreams of a better life fade, and she becomes resigned to her circumstances. Her health deteriorates, and she loses her business, ultimately falling into poverty and despair.

Her interactions with characters like the Goujets, the Lorilleuxs, and the Poissons reflect the social dynamics and challenges faced by those living in the city.

In the end, Gervaise's life is marked by tragedy and loss. Her daughter Nana grows up in an environment of neglect and vice, and Gervaise herself becomes a shadow of the hopeful woman she once was.
