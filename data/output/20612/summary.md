In 1758, during the French and Indian War, Ensign John a Cleeve of the 46th Regiment is part of a British expedition aiming to capture Fort Carillon from the French. The campaign is led by General Abercromby, with young and admired Lord Howe as a key figure. John, idealistic and eager for glory, is caught up in the excitement of the military advance, which is vividly described with the British forces crossing Lake George in a grand flotilla.

The narrative shifts to Fort Carillon, where French commander Montcalm prepares his defenses, aware of the British advance. Despite being outnumbered, Montcalm's strategic acumen allows him to construct formidable defenses with the help of his men. As the British attack, they suffer heavy casualties due to poor planning and the strength of the French position. During the assault, Lord Howe is killed, a blow to British morale and particularly to John, who idolized him.

John is injured in the chaotic battle and later captured by the French, along with other British soldiers. He is taken northward, deeper into French territory, where he encounters various characters, including Sergeant Barboux, a boastful and unpleasant French soldier, and Menehwehna, an Ojibway Indian who shows him unexpected kindness.

As a prisoner, John wrestles with his identity and loyalties, especially when he is mistaken for a French sergeant due to a mix-up with uniforms. His journey takes him through the wilderness, where he is forced to adapt to the ways of the Native Americans. During this time, he reflects on his upbringing, his family, and his place in the world.

Eventually, John finds himself at Fort Amitie, a remote French outpost commanded by the noble Commandant and his daughter, Diane. Here, John is drawn into a web of deception and intrigue, as he must maintain his disguise to avoid execution as a deserter. Despite his inner turmoil, he develops feelings for Diane, who is unaware of his true identity.

The narrative explores themes of honor, identity, and the moral complexities of war. John is torn between his duty as a British officer and his growing affection for the people who have shown him kindness, particularly Diane. His journey is one of self-discovery, as he confronts the harsh realities of war and the choices that define a man's character.

Throughout the story, John grapples with his conscience, ultimately deciding to betray his captors to save his own life and return to the British side. However, this decision is fraught with guilt, as he must reconcile his actions with his sense of honor and the love he feels for Diane.

The story concludes with John returning to British lines, where he is eventually cleared of desertion charges due to his valuable intelligence. He is left to ponder the cost of his choices and the possibility of redemption, both personally and in the eyes of those he has come to care for. The narrative ends with a reflection on the nature of heroism and the enduring impact of war on the human soul.
