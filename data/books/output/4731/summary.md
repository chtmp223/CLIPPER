The story unfolds in Australia, where the Woolcot family, led by Captain Woolcot, lives in a house affectionately known as Misrule. The family is large and lively, comprising seven children: Meg, Pip, Judy, Nell, Bunty, Baby, and the youngest, known as the General. Their mother has passed away, and their young stepmother, Esther, struggles to manage the vibrant and unruly household.

The narrative begins with the children exhibiting their mischievous and spirited nature, much to the exasperation of their father, who is strict and often overwhelmed by their antics. The children's escapades are numerous, ranging from sneaking food to causing chaos with their pranks. Judy, the most spirited of them all, often leads these adventures, which sometimes result in severe consequences.

One pivotal incident involves Judy leaving the General at the barracks, causing a scandal that leads to her being sent to boarding school as punishment. This decision is a significant turning point, deeply affecting the family dynamics and highlighting the Captain's struggle to maintain authority while dealing with his grief-stricken and rebellious daughter.

Meg, the eldest, is navigating the complexities of adolescence, influenced by her friend Aldith MacCarthy, who introduces her to the world of fashion and flirtation. Meg's journey is marked by a desire to be grown-up and sophisticated, leading her to experiment with her appearance and engage in secretive interactions with boys, which culminate in a humiliating incident that teaches her a valuable lesson about authenticity and self-respect.

Throughout the story, the children's escapades are set against the backdrop of their father's stern discipline and their stepmother's attempts to provide care and guidance. The Captain is portrayed as a man struggling with his role, often harsh but ultimately caring, while Esther, though well-meaning, finds herself overwhelmed by the responsibilities of motherhood.

A significant event occurs when Judy, in an act of heroism, saves the General from a falling tree but is gravely injured in the process. Her subsequent death is a profound moment that brings the family closer and forces them to confront their emotions and relationships. Judy's passing leaves a lasting impact, particularly on Meg, who matures significantly as she reflects on her sister's life and her own actions.

As the family copes with their loss, they begin to find new ways to support one another. Meg, in particular, grows from her experiences, learning to balance her youthful dreams with the responsibilities and realities of life. The story closes with a sense of hope and renewal, as the family, though changed by tragedy, remains united and resilient in the face of their challenges.
