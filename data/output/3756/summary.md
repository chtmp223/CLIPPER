Archie Moffam, a charming but somewhat hapless Englishman, navigates life in New York after marrying Lucille Brewster, the daughter of the wealthy hotel owner Daniel Brewster. Archie’s life is a series of comedic misadventures, largely revolving around his attempts to win the approval of his stern father-in-law and his efforts to find gainful employment.

In the opening chapter, Archie’s introduction to Mr. Brewster is less than ideal, as he inadvertently insults the hotel Cosmopolis, which Mr. Brewster owns. Despite this rocky start, Archie remains optimistic and determined to make a good impression.

One of Archie’s early schemes involves posing as a model for an artist named J.B. Wheeler, which leads to a series of misunderstandings and mishaps, including a mix-up with a snake named Peter. Archie’s attempts to hide the snake result in chaos, especially when it escapes and causes panic in the hotel.

Archie’s life is further complicated by his brother-in-law Bill Brewster’s romantic entanglements. Bill falls in love with a chorus girl named Mabel Winchester, much to the dismay of the conservative Brewster family. Archie tries to help Bill by arranging for Mabel to perform at the hotel, hoping to impress a music publisher and secure her a legitimate career, but the plan backfires spectacularly.

Throughout the story, Archie’s interactions with various colorful characters, including a press agent named Roscoe Sherriff and a valet named Parker, add to the comedic chaos. Parker, who was dismissed by Mr. Brewster, seeks Archie’s help to regain his position, leading to further complications.

Archie’s well-meaning but often misguided attempts to help his friends and family often end in disaster, yet his charm and good nature usually manage to win the day. Despite frequent misunderstandings and the occasional ire of Mr. Brewster, Archie’s relationship with Lucille remains strong, and his optimism never wavers.

In the end, Archie’s efforts to please his father-in-law and support his friends culminate in a series of humorous episodes that highlight his bumbling yet lovable nature. His adventures are a testament to the enduring power of good intentions, even when they go hilariously awry.
