The story begins with a young boy named Jim Burden, who is traveling to Nebraska to live with his grandparents after the death of his parents. During his journey, he hears about a family of Bohemian immigrants, the Shimerdas, who are also heading to Nebraska. Jim is accompanied by Jake Marpole, a farmhand from his father's farm in Virginia. They travel in day-coaches, feeling sticky and grimy, and are under the care of a friendly conductor who informs them about the immigrant family.

Upon arriving in Black Hawk, Nebraska, Jim meets Otto Fuchs, his grandfather's hired man, who takes them to their new home. Jim is introduced to the vast, open plains of Nebraska, a stark contrast to the mountains he is used to. The Shimerda family, who live nearby, are struggling to adapt to their new life. Mr. Shimerda, the father, is a weaver by trade and finds it difficult to farm. His daughter, Ántonia, is a bright and lively girl who quickly becomes friends with Jim.

As Jim settles into his new life, he spends a lot of time with Ántonia, exploring the countryside and learning about her family's struggles. The Shimerdas face harsh conditions and poverty, relying on the unscrupulous Krajiek, their only interpreter, who takes advantage of them. Despite these challenges, Ántonia remains optimistic and eager to learn English from Jim.

Jim's life in Nebraska is filled with the simplicity and beauty of the prairie, but also the harsh realities of immigrant life. He witnesses the hardships faced by the Shimerdas, including the tragic death of Mr. Shimerda, who is found dead in their barn, having taken his own life. This event deeply affects Ántonia and her family, leaving them to fend for themselves.

Throughout the story, Jim grows and matures, forming a bond with Ántonia that transcends the challenges they face. He experiences the changing seasons, the beauty of the land, and the struggles of the people around him. Ántonia becomes a symbol of resilience and strength, embodying the spirit of the pioneers who settled the American frontier.

As the years pass, Jim moves away to attend college, but the memories of his time in Nebraska and his friendship with Ántonia remain with him. He learns about the lives of the people he left behind, including Ántonia, who marries and raises a large family. Despite the passage of time and the changes in their lives, the bond between Jim and Ántonia endures, representing the enduring connection to one's roots and the land that shaped them.

The story is a poignant reflection on the immigrant experience, the challenges of frontier life, and the enduring power of friendship and memory. Through Jim's eyes, we see the beauty and hardship of life on the prairie and the indomitable spirit of those who made it their home.
