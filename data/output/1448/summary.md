In a quaint village named Mayenfeld, a young girl named Heidi embarks on a journey up the mountain with her Aunt Dete. Dressed in layers to shield against the cold, Heidi is led by Dete to her grandfather, Alm-Uncle, who lives in seclusion. Despite Dete's warnings about Alm-Uncle's reclusive and intimidating nature, Heidi is unfazed and excited about her new home.

As they climb, they meet Barbel, a local woman, who is shocked at Dete's plan to leave Heidi with Alm-Uncle. Dete insists that Alm-Uncle, being Heidi's grandfather, should take responsibility for her. Dete reveals her own plans to take a job in Frankfurt, leaving Heidi in her grandfather's care.

Upon reaching Alm-Uncle's hut, Heidi is introduced to her grandfather, a gruff but kind-hearted man. Despite his initial reluctance, Alm-Uncle accepts Heidi into his home. Heidi quickly adapts to her new life, enchanted by the beauty of the mountains and the companionship of Peter, the goatherd, and his goats.

As time passes, Heidi becomes a beloved figure in the village, and her presence softens Alm-Uncle's demeanor. However, Dete returns to take Heidi to Frankfurt, where she is to be a companion to a wealthy, sickly girl named Clara Sesemann. Heidi is reluctant but eventually goes, leaving her grandfather and the mountains behind.

In Frankfurt, Heidi struggles with homesickness and the strict household of Clara's family, managed by the stern Fraulein Rottenmeier. Despite her challenges, Heidi's innocence and charm win over Clara and her grandmother, Frau Sesemann. Heidi's presence brings joy to Clara, who finds a new zest for life through their friendship.

Heidi's longing for the mountains grows, affecting her health and spirit. Clara's grandmother, noticing Heidi's unhappiness, encourages her to pray and trust that God will make things right. Eventually, Heidi's homesickness becomes so severe that she begins sleepwalking, prompting the family doctor to recommend her return to the mountains.

Back in the Alps, Heidi's return is met with joy by Alm-Uncle and the villagers. Her health and happiness are restored, and she resumes her carefree life with Peter and the goats. Clara, inspired by Heidi's stories of the mountains, convinces her father to let her visit Heidi. The fresh mountain air and Heidi's encouragement lead to a miraculous improvement in Clara's health, allowing her to walk again.

The story concludes with the Sesemann family expressing their gratitude to Alm-Uncle for Heidi's influence on Clara. Heidi's simple faith and love have brought healing and joy to those around her, reaffirming the beauty of her mountain home and the power of friendship and faith.
