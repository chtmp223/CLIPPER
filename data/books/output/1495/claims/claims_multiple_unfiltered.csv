2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship between these parts is not meaningful or coherent, as the claim incorrectly attributes actions to characters that are not supported by the chapter outline.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
