Allan Montague, a lawyer from Mississippi, finds himself entangled in the social and financial web of New York City. He is introduced to the city's elite by his brother Oliver and becomes acquainted with various influential figures, including Jim Hegan, a powerful financier, and Stanley Ryder, president of the Gotham Trust Company. Montague's childhood friend, Lucy Dupree, a Southern widow, arrives in New York with hopes of establishing herself in society. Her beauty and charm attract attention, particularly from Ryder.

Montague is tasked with managing Lucy's financial affairs, including her shares in the Northern Mississippi Railroad. He attempts to negotiate their sale, hoping to secure a better future for Lucy. However, Lucy secretly sells the stock to Ryder for a note, complicating Montague's efforts and straining their friendship. Meanwhile, Montague becomes increasingly aware of the corruption and manipulation within the financial world, especially as he witnesses the machinations of Dan Waterman, a Wall Street titan.

Waterman, who harbors a personal vendetta against Ryder, engineers a financial panic to ruin him. Lucy, caught between her affections for Ryder and the chaos of the financial world, becomes a pawn in this high-stakes game. Despite Montague's warnings, she remains entangled with Ryder, leading to a tragic end when Ryder, facing ruin, attempts suicide. Lucy, overwhelmed by the scandal and her role in Ryder's downfall, disappears, leaving Montague to grapple with the consequences of their involvement in the treacherous world of New York's elite.

Throughout the narrative, Montague struggles with his moral compass, trying to navigate a world where wealth and power dictate actions and relationships. He is drawn into the intrigues of high society, witnessing the superficiality and ruthlessness that define it. His experiences leave him disillusioned with the city's social scene, prompting him to consider a future in politics, where he hopes to effect change and fight against the corruption he has witnessed.
