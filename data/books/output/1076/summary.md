The narrative unfolds with the story of Kai Lung, a storyteller who finds himself in a precarious situation when he is captured by the brigand Lin Yi. In an attempt to save his life, Kai Lung entertains Lin Yi and his followers with tales, including the story of Ling, a young man whose life is marked by a series of unfortunate events.

Ling, the protagonist of the tale, is the youngest of three sons, known for his mild and studious nature. Dissatisfied with the hereditary worship of apes practiced by his family, Ling decides to pursue a literary career by taking the public examinations in Canton, hoping to escape the impending conscription into the army. His journey to Canton is fraught with deceit as he is misled by fellow candidates and manipulated by corrupt officials who extort money from him under the guise of examination fees.

Despite these challenges, Ling manages to sit for the examinations, placing his hopes on his unique knowledge and preparation. However, the results are disappointing as Ling's efforts are neither rewarded nor recognized, leaving him in a state of despair. His fortunes take a further downturn when he is unexpectedly appointed as a commander of archers in Si-chow, a role for which he feels ill-suited due to his lack of military experience.

Upon arriving in Si-chow, Ling encounters the harsh realities of his new position. The region is rife with rebellion, and the bowmen under his command are undisciplined and untrustworthy. Ling's attempts to lead are undermined by the self-serving Chief of Bowmen and the treacherous Mandarin Li Keen, whose cowardice and deceitful reports to Peking paint Ling as incompetent and dead, despite Ling's valiant efforts to defend the town from rebels.

Amidst the turmoil, Ling finds solace in Mian, a maiden whose life he saves from bandits. Their mutual affection grows, but Ling's duties and the manipulations of those in power keep them apart. Ling's journey to Canton to report the truth of his actions is met with further betrayal, as the official records have been altered to discredit him. Disillusioned and officially declared dead, Ling contemplates his fate and the hopelessness of his situation.

In a final act of despair, Ling drinks a potion given to him by Mian, intended as a means of escape from unbearable circumstances. The narrative leaves Ling's fate ambiguous, reflecting the overarching theme of the story: the struggle against an unjust fate and the pursuit of integrity in a world rife with corruption and deceit. Through Kai Lung's storytelling, the brigands are entertained and perhaps enlightened, as the tale of Ling serves as both a cautionary and inspirational narrative about resilience and the complexities of destiny.
