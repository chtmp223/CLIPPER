Chapter 8 then details how Penrod and Sam find Whitey in the stable and decide to keep him for a potential reward. The boys proceed to feed Whitey various items, including a maple branch, water, apples, vegetables, and a loaf of bread. This sequence of events shows the direct cause and effect relationship between Whitey's arrival and the boys' subsequent actions.","The corrupted fact incorrectly states that the boys decide to sell Whitey for immediate profit, while the outline clearly states they decide to keep him for a potential reward. Additionally, the corrupted fact mentions feeding Whitey only hay and water, which contradicts the detailed list of food items provided in the outline.","Chapter 7, 8","- Chapter 7, item 7: Whitey, confused and exhausted, returns to the Schofields' carriage-house and enters an empty stall.

Relationship: Cause and effect, temporal sequence",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""After Whitey enters an empty stall in the Schofields' carriage-house"": This part is grounded in event 7 of Chapter 7, where Whitey, the horse, returns to the Schofields' carriage-house and enters an empty stall.
    b. ""Penrod and Sam find him and decide to keep him for a potential reward"": This part is grounded in event 1 of Chapter 8, where Penrod and Sam find Whitey in the stable and decide to keep him for a potential reward.
    c. ""feeding him an enormous amount of food including a maple branch, water, apples, vegetables, and a loaf of bread"": This part is grounded in events 2, 3, and 4 of Chapter 8, where Penrod and Sam feed Whitey a variety of foods, including a maple branch, water, apples, vegetables, and a loaf of bread.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The sequence of events follows logically: Whitey enters the stall, Penrod and Sam find him, decide to keep him, and then feed him.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation or assumption; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it aligns with the narrative of Penrod and Sam's misadventures and their misguided but earnest efforts to care for Whitey.

Since all atomic parts are grounded in the chapter outline and the relationship between them is valid and meaningful, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""After Whitey enters an empty stall in the Schofields' carriage-house"": This part is grounded in event 7 of Chapter 7, where Whitey returns to the Schofields' carriage-house and enters an empty stall.
   b. ""Penrod and Sam find him and decide to sell him for immediate profit"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. In Chapter 8, Penrod and Sam find Whitey and decide to keep him for a potential reward, not to sell him for immediate profit.
   c. ""feeding him only hay and water"": This part contradicts the chapter outline. In Chapter 8, Penrod and Sam feed Whitey a variety of foods, including a maple branch, apples, vegetables, and a loaf of bread, not just hay and water.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid because the claim misrepresents the boys' intentions and actions regarding Whitey. The chapter outline clearly states that they aim to keep Whitey for a potential reward and feed him a diverse diet, not just hay and water.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship contradicts the information in the chapter outline, as it inaccurately describes the boys' actions and intentions.

Since parts 1b. and 1c. are not grounded in the chapter outline, and the relationship between the atomic parts is not valid, the claim is INVALID."
