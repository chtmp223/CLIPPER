- Chapter 24, item 1: The narrator rides around Tunnel Mountain, observing the Bow River Valley and reflecting on the geological history of the Rocky Mountains.
- Relationship: Tourism and geological observations in the Rocky Mountains",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Tourism in the Rocky Mountains involved both train stops at scenic locations like Mount Robson"": This part is grounded in Chapter 5, where the train stops at Mount Robson, allowing passengers to view the mountain and its surroundings.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the claim is contradicted by the chapter outline, which provides evidence of horseback riding and geological observation.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the outline explicitly mentions activities beyond train travel.

Since both atomic parts are contradicted by the chapter outline, and the relationship between them is not valid, the claim is INVALID."
