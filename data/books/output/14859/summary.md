Hal and Mab Blake, two curious and energetic children, are eager to find fun activities on a warm spring day. Their mother, Mrs. Blake, suggests they play games, but the children are dissatisfied with their options. Hal is uninterested in playing with dolls, and Mab is not keen on playing tag due to the muddy conditions. Mrs. Blake encourages them to think creatively and come up with a new game. As they discuss the changing seasons and the arrival of spring, their mother explains how the sun brings about the warmer weather, causing the trees to bud and flowers to grow.

The children's father, Daddy Blake, returns home with a surpriseâ€”a new game that takes all spring, summer, and part of the fall to play. He introduces them to the concept of a garden game, where they will plant and tend to a garden, with the promise of a ten-dollar gold piece as a prize for whoever grows the best crops. The family, including Uncle Pennywait and Aunt Lolly, will all participate, choosing different vegetables to grow.

The children learn about the process of planting seeds and the importance of preparing the soil. Daddy Blake explains the role of sunlight, water, and air in helping seeds germinate and grow. Hal chooses to plant corn, while Mab opts for beans. As they begin their gardening adventure, they encounter various challenges, such as weeds, bugs, and weather conditions, which they must overcome to ensure their crops thrive.

Throughout the growing season, Hal and Mab learn valuable lessons about patience, hard work, and the wonders of nature. They experience the excitement of seeing their plants sprout and grow, and they take pride in their efforts as their garden begins to yield vegetables. The family also faces setbacks, such as a hailstorm that threatens their crops, but they learn to adapt and continue their gardening journey.

As the summer progresses, the garden produces more vegetables than the family can consume, prompting Hal and Mab to set up a small market on their front lawn. They sell their fresh produce to neighbors and passersby, experiencing the joy of earning money from their hard work. The children gain a deeper appreciation for the earth's bounty and the importance of not wasting food.

The story highlights the importance of family, teamwork, and the rewards of dedication and perseverance. Through their gardening adventure, Hal and Mab not only learn about agriculture and nature but also develop a sense of responsibility and an understanding of the value of food. The garden game becomes a memorable and educational experience for the entire Blake family, fostering a love for nature and a spirit of cooperation.
