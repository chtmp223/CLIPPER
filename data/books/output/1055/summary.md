The narrative begins with the protagonist, a ship captain, arriving at a port after a long sea voyage. The morning after docking, he is visited by Mr. Jacobus, a prominent local merchant, who unexpectedly boards his ship. Despite the captain's initial suspicion of Jacobus's intentions, he is reminded by a letter from his ship's owners that they had recommended he connect with Jacobus for potential business opportunities. Jacobus's visit, marked by an unusual breakfast spread, piques the captain's curiosity and he decides to pursue the connection, despite his reservations about the commercial world.

The captain attends a funeral of a fellow captain's child, where he observes the emotional reactions of the other sea captains, contrasting with his own detachment. He is approached by Captain Hâ€”, whose ship had suffered a loss at sea, and learns that Jacobus had been helpful during the family's crisis. This interaction deepens the captain's intrigue about Jacobus, who seems to be a man of contradictions.

The captain's next encounter with Jacobus reveals more about the merchant's personal life. Jacobus's brother, Ernest, is a wealthy and influential figure in the local business community, but the two brothers have not spoken in years due to a scandal involving Jacobus's infatuation with a circus performer. This scandal resulted in Jacobus becoming an outcast, raising his daughter from the affair in isolation. The captain learns that Jacobus lives with his daughter, Alice, and a domineering old woman who oversees the household.

The captain becomes a frequent visitor to Jacobus's home, driven by a fascination with Alice, a reclusive and mysterious figure. Despite her indifference and the old woman's hostility, he is drawn to Alice's enigmatic presence. Over time, the captain becomes emotionally entangled, struggling with his feelings for Alice, who is portrayed as both contemptuous and alluring.

Jacobus eventually helps the captain by arranging for a supply of much-needed bags for his ship's cargo, facilitating a reconciliation with his brother, Ernest. The captain, in turn, agrees to a deal with Jacobus involving a purchase of potatoes, which he later finds to be a profitable venture due to a potato shortage in the colony. This transaction, however, leaves the captain feeling morally compromised, as it ties him further to Jacobus and the dubious circumstances surrounding the merchant's life.

As the captain prepares to leave port, he reflects on his experiences with Jacobus and Alice. He is haunted by the memory of a kiss with Alice, realizing the depth of his detachment from her and the emptiness of his desires. Despite the financial gain from the potato deal, he is disillusioned and decides to resign his command, feeling that the Indian Ocean and its associations have lost their charm for him. He plans to return home as a passenger, leaving the ship and its future in the hands of his loyal mate, Mr. Burns.

The story concludes with the captain's resignation, underscoring his inner turmoil and the impact of his entanglement with Jacobus and Alice. The narrative explores themes of moral ambiguity, the complexities of human relationships, and the contrast between the allure of adventure and the harsh realities of life.
