    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. Jane's decision to release the sailors directly leads to her being overpowered, which in turn necessitates Tarzan's rescue.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly grounded in the sequence of events described in the chapter outline.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it follows a logical progression of events.

Since all atomic parts are grounded in the chapter outline and the relationship between them is valid and meaningful, the claim is consistent with the provided information.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""Jane's decision to release two imprisoned sailors in an attempt to set the Kincaid adrift"": This part is grounded in event 5 of Chapter 16, where Jane releases two imprisoned sailors and attempts to set the Kincaid adrift.
    b. ""succeeds when the freed sailors help her escape after hearing gunshots and a woman's scream from upriver"": This part is not supported by the chapter outline. Instead, event 7 of Chapter 16 indicates that Jane is overpowered by the sailors she released when distracted by gunshots and a woman's scream from upriver.
    c. ""leading to Tarzan swimming to the shore to meet them"": This part is not directly supported by the chapter outline. Event 2 of Chapter 17 mentions Tarzan swimming to the Kincaid after hearing gunfire, but it does not specify that he is meeting Jane and the sailors.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not objectively valid. The claim suggests a causal link between Jane's actions and the sailors helping her escape, which contradicts the chapter outline where the sailors overpower her.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the events do not align with the claim's narrative.

Since 1b., 1c., 2a., and 2b. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."

First, a battle ensues on deck between Tarzan's allies and Rokoff's men. Then, Rokoff is thrown onto the deck by his own men, where he faces Sheeta the panther. Finally, Sheeta attacks and kills Rokoff on the bridge of the Kincaid, with Tarzan watching. This progression shows how the chaos of the battle leads to Rokoff's demise at the hands (or paws) of Sheeta.","This corrupted fact incorrectly states that Tarzan throws Rokoff onto the deck (instead of Rokoff's own men), that Numa the lion kills Rokoff (instead of Sheeta the panther), and that Jane watches (instead of Tarzan).

   a. ""During the battle on the Kincaid's deck between Tarzan's allies and Rokoff's men"": This part is grounded in event 4 of Chapter 17, where a battle ensues on the deck.
   b. ""Rokoff is thrown onto the deck by his own crew"": This part is grounded in event 5 of Chapter 17, where Rokoff is indeed thrown onto the deck by his own men.
   c. ""where he is attacked and killed by Sheeta the panther while Tarzan watches"": This part is grounded in event 6 of Chapter 17, where Sheeta attacks and kills Rokoff on the bridge of the Kincaid while Tarzan watches.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The sequence of events is clearly outlined in the chapter, with Rokoff being thrown onto the deck, followed by Sheeta attacking and killing him.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline. There is no contradiction, and the events are consistent with the narrative of Tarzan's confrontation with Rokoff.

   a. ""During the battle on the Kincaid's deck between Tarzan's allies and Rokoff's men"": This part is grounded in event 4 of Chapter 17, where a battle ensues on the deck.
   b. ""Rokoff is thrown onto the deck by Tarzan"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The outline states that Rokoff is thrown onto the deck by his own men, not by Tarzan (event 5).
   c. ""where he is attacked and killed by Numa the lion"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The outline specifies that Sheeta the panther attacks and kills Rokoff, not Numa the lion (event 6).
   d. ""while Jane watches"": This part is not mentioned in the chapter outline. The outline does not specify Jane's presence or her witnessing the event.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the claim contains inaccuracies regarding who throws Rokoff onto the deck and which animal kills him.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline due to the inaccuracies in the claim.

Since parts 1b., 1c., and 1d. are not grounded in the chapter outline, and the relationship between the atomic parts is not valid, the claim is INVALID."
