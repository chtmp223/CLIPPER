The narrative revolves around Paragot, a charismatic and eccentric vagabond, and his young protégé, Asticot. Paragot, whose real name is Gaston de Nérac, is a man of many talents and mysteries, known for his philosophical musings and bohemian lifestyle. He adopts Asticot, a neglected boy from the streets of London, and takes him under his wing, teaching him about life, art, and philosophy as they wander through Europe.

Paragot's past is shrouded in mystery, including a series of love letters to a woman named Joanna, whom he adored but lost due to circumstances beyond his control. These letters reveal a passionate love affair and a life once filled with promise and ambition. However, Paragot's life took a turn, leading him to a vagabond existence, seeking truth and meaning across the continent.

The story unfolds with Paragot and Asticot traveling through France, Italy, and beyond, living off odd jobs and the kindness of strangers. They are joined by a dog named Narcisse and later a young woman named Blanquette, whom Paragot saves from a life of hardship. Blanquette, a zither player, becomes part of their makeshift family, adding to the dynamic of their travels.

Paragot's character is complex; he is both a mentor and a flawed human being. His journey is as much about self-discovery as it is about teaching Asticot. He struggles with his past, particularly his relationship with Joanna, which haunts him throughout their travels. Despite his eccentricities and occasional bouts of melancholy, Paragot's influence on Asticot is profound, shaping the boy's understanding of the world and his place in it.

The narrative is rich with vivid descriptions of the places they visit and the people they encounter, painting a picture of a Europe filled with both beauty and struggle. Paragot's philosophical insights and whimsical adventures provide a backdrop for Asticot's coming-of-age story, as he learns about love, loyalty, and the complexities of human nature.

As they journey through life together, Paragot's past catches up with him when they encounter Joanna at a café in Aix-les-Bains. This meeting brings back memories and unresolved emotions, leading to a moment of crisis for Paragot. However, he ultimately chooses to continue his journey with Asticot and Blanquette, reaffirming his commitment to the life he has chosen.

The story concludes with Paragot deciding to settle down for the winter in Buda-Pesth, symbolizing a temporary pause in their endless wanderings. It is a tale of redemption, friendship, and the search for meaning in a world that is both enchanting and unforgiving. Through Paragot's adventures and teachings, Asticot learns to navigate the complexities of life, carrying forward the lessons of his beloved master.
