    a. Alice prepares for an evening event by asking her mother for money: This part is grounded in event 6 of Chapter 2, where Alice asks her mother for money to buy accessories for an event that evening.

    b. The relationship is not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline due to the incorrect detail about accessories.
    c. The relationship does not contradict any information in the summary, but it is not coherent with the chapter outline due to the incorrect detail.
