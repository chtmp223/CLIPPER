The narrative begins with Julian West, a man from the 19th century, who falls into a deep sleep in an underground chamber in Boston in 1887. He awakens in the year 2000, in a society vastly transformed from the one he knew. He is discovered by Dr. Leete, a kindly and intelligent man who, along with his family, becomes Julian's guide to understanding the new world.

Dr. Leete explains that the world has undergone a radical transformation, moving from a society based on individualism, competition, and private enterprise to one characterized by cooperation, equality, and nationalized industries. In this new world, the concept of money has been abolished. Instead of wages, each citizen receives a credit card from the government, which allows them to procure goods from national storehouses, ensuring that everyone's needs are met equally.

The labor question, a significant issue in Julian's time, has been resolved by organizing the entire population into an industrial army. Service is mandatory for all able-bodied citizens, who work from the age of 21 to 45. The society values effort over output, meaning everyone is expected to contribute their best according to their abilities. This system eliminates competition and promotes a sense of community, as everyone works for the common good rather than personal gain.

Julian is intrigued by the absence of poverty and the presence of universal education and healthcare, which have improved the overall quality of life and physical and mental health of the population. Women, in particular, have found liberation from domestic drudgery and enjoy equal opportunities in education and careers, leading to a more equitable society.

As Julian explores the city, he is struck by the stark contrast between the Boston of his time and the utopian society of the 20th century. The city is clean, efficient, and beautiful, with public spaces and buildings designed for the enjoyment and benefit of all citizens. There is a strong sense of community and mutual respect among the people, who are no longer driven by the fear of poverty or the desire for excessive wealth.

Julian also learns about the social and political systems that support this society. There are no politicians or political parties as he knew them; instead, the government is run by individuals chosen for their abilities and integrity, ensuring that corruption and demagoguery are things of the past.

Throughout his journey, Julian forms a close bond with Edith Leete, Dr. Leete's daughter. She helps him navigate the emotional and intellectual challenges of adjusting to this new world. Edith reveals to Julian that she is the great-granddaughter of his lost love, Edith Bartlett, which deepens their connection and provides Julian with a sense of continuity and belonging.

The story concludes with Julian coming to terms with his new life and the extraordinary changes in society. He realizes that the world he has awakened to, with its emphasis on equality, cooperation, and the well-being of all, is a far better place than the one he left behind. The narrative leaves the reader with a sense of hope and possibility for a future where humanity has overcome its baser instincts and achieved a truly just and harmonious society.
