- Relationship: Jekyll's behavior after Carew's murder",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Dr. Jekyll's renewed social life and religious activities for about two months after Sir Danvers Carew's murder"": This part is grounded in event 1 of Chapter 6, where it is mentioned that after the murder, Hyde disappears, and Jekyll resumes his social life and religious activities.
   b. ""correspond to his resolution to abandon Hyde"": This part is grounded in event 4 of Chapter 10, where Jekyll resolves to abandon Hyde after the murder of Sir Danvers Carew.
   c. ""though he eventually gives in to temptation"": This part is grounded in event 4 of Chapter 10, where it is mentioned that Jekyll eventually gives in to temptation despite his resolution.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The claim connects Jekyll's renewed social life and religious activities with his resolution to abandon Hyde, which is a logical consequence of his decision to distance himself from Hyde's actions.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly supported by the chapter outline, which shows Jekyll's attempt to reform after the murder and his eventual failure to maintain this resolution.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as both sources indicate Jekyll's struggle with his dual nature and his temporary attempts to suppress Hyde.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID."
