    a. Jamie's family receives unexpected financial aid from strangers on two occasions: This part is grounded in the events described in the chapter outlines.
    b. First, when a farmer helps after confronting Jamie with a gun: This part is grounded in Chapter 2, where a farmer, after initially confronting Jamie, helps by providing milk and later returns with potatoes and milk.
    c. Later, when Felix Boyle unknowingly drops change while drunk in their home: This part is grounded in Chapter 7, where Felix Boyle, after falling asleep drunk, drops change, which is then used to buy food and supplies.
