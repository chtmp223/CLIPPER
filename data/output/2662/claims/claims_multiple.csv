"Fancy's encounters with Mr. Shiner, including a lesson on catching bullfinches by the stream and his flirtatious attempts in the garden, become a source of tension in her relationship with Dick.","Fancy's encounters with Mr. Shiner, including a lesson on fishing by the stream and his successful flirtation in the garden, strengthen her relationship with Dick.","In Chapter 20, Fancy confesses to Dick about her encounter with Mr. Shiner by the stream, where he taught her how to catch bullfinches. This confession indicates that the interaction was significant enough to cause concern. Later, in Chapter 23, we see another instance where Shiner attempts to flirt with Fancy when they are left alone in the garden, but she rebuffs him. These encounters demonstrate the ongoing presence of Shiner as a potential rival for Fancy's affections, creating tension in her relationship with Dick.","The corrupted fact incorrectly states that Shiner taught Fancy fishing (instead of catching bullfinches) and that his flirtation was successful, which contradicts the outline.
