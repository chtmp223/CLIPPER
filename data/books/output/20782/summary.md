In a distant future where interplanetary travel is routine, the story unfolds aboard the Interplanetary liner Hyperion, commanded by Captain Bradley. The ship is on high alert due to the mysterious disappearances of two other vessels, the Dione and the Rhea. Despite advanced detector screens and defensive armament, the crew is wary of rumored space pirates with seemingly impossible technology.

Conway Costigan, the burly young first officer, is aboard the Hyperion, which is suddenly attacked by an invisible force. Aboard the ship is Clio Marsden, a passenger and the belle of the voyage, who is caught in a deadly gas attack orchestrated by a saboteur. Costigan, using his quick wits and knowledge of the lethal Vee-Two gas, manages to save Clio and himself by donning space suits and reaching an airlock, but the rest of the ship's crew and passengers are incapacitated. 

The Hyperion is captured by a massive, mysterious planetoid controlled by a ruthless mastermind known as Roger. Costigan, Clio, and Captain Bradley are taken prisoner and separated. Roger, a man of immense power and intellect, reveals his plans to extract resources from the Solar System using his advanced technology. The captives learn that Roger intends to use them for his own ends or dispose of them if they refuse to cooperate.

Meanwhile, in a parallel narrative, the Triplanetary League's Secret Service, led by Virgil Samms, is on high alert. The League's newest and most advanced heavy cruiser, the Chicago, is patrolling space when it receives a distress call from the Hyperion. Lyman Cleveland, an operative of the Secret Service, is aboard the Chicago and uses advanced ultra-wave technology to trace the source of the interference that destroyed the Hyperion. The League mobilizes its forces, but they are no match for the unknown enemy with superior technology.

Costigan, using his ingenuity and the advanced technology of his captors, manages to communicate with Clio and Bradley. They plan an escape, leveraging their captors' underestimation of them. Costigan eventually escapes his cell and rescues Clio, using the Nevians' own technology against them. They manage to capture a Nevian lifeboat and flee, but not before Costigan unleashes a deadly gas to incapacitate their captors.

As they flee, Costigan and Clio are pursued by the Nevians, an amphibious alien race with advanced technology, who are also in conflict with Roger's forces. The Nevians are revealed to have come from a distant solar system in search of iron, a precious resource on their planet. The Nevians had previously attacked Earth's cities, including Pittsburgh, using their advanced technology to extract iron.

In a climactic battle, the Triplanetary super-ship Boise, rebuilt with technology gleaned from both Roger's and the Nevians' advancements, engages the Nevian forces. The Boise, commanded by scientists Rodebush and Cleveland, proves to be a formidable opponent, capable of matching the Nevians' technology. After a series of intense battles, a truce is brokered between the Nevians and the Triplanetary League, recognizing the potential for mutual benefit through peaceful exchanges of resources and knowledge.

The story concludes with Costigan and Clio, now deeply in love, looking forward to a future together. Despite the peace treaty, Clio remains uneasy about the Nevians, reflecting a lingering distrust of the alien race among humans. The narrative ends with the hope that the newfound peace will hold, allowing both civilizations to prosper.
