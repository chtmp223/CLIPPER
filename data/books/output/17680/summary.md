The narrative opens in the opulent yet financially strained world of the Sansevero family, whose fortunes are dwindling under the weight of Prince Alessandro Sansevero's gambling debts. His American wife, the Princess Sansevero, is determined to maintain appearances and provide a grand Roman season for her niece, Nina Randolph, an American heiress. The princess hopes to introduce Nina to Roman society and potentially find her a suitable match, though she is wary of the motives of Italian nobility who might court Nina for her wealth.

The story unfolds against the backdrop of Italy's rich cultural heritage, with vivid descriptions of the Sansevero's ancestral home and the vibrant social life of Rome. Nina is initially captivated by the beauty and romance of her surroundings and is particularly intrigued by her charming and enigmatic cousin, Don Giovanni Sansevero. Giovanni, with his noble lineage and effortless grace, becomes a central figure in Nina's Roman experience. However, Nina soon discovers the complexities and hidden agendas of those around her.

The Duke Scorpa, a calculating and sinister figure, emerges as a significant threat to the Sansevero family. He has orchestrated a scheme involving the illegal sale of a valuable Raphael painting from the Sansevero collection, intending to entrap Prince Alessandro in a scandal. The duke's ulterior motives are further complicated by his interest in marrying Nina, viewing her as a means to consolidate his power and wealth.

As Nina navigates the treacherous waters of Roman society, she encounters various suitors, each with their own designs on her fortune. The Contessa Potensi, a woman of questionable morals, and the ambitious Count Tornik are among those vying for her attention. Nina's interactions with these characters reveal the stark contrasts between European and American values, highlighting themes of love, loyalty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Amidst the social intrigue, Nina finds herself drawn to John Derby, an old friend from America who is working on a mining project in Sicily. John's straightforwardness and integrity stand in sharp contrast to the duplicity she encounters in Rome. His presence offers Nina a sense of stability and familiarity, and she begins to question her initial fascination with Giovanni.

As the narrative progresses, the tension between Giovanni and the Duke Scorpa escalates, culminating in a duel that leaves Giovanni wounded and the duke dead. Giovanni's actions, motivated by a desire to protect Nina's honor, reveal his complex nature and the depth of his feelings for her. However, Nina's growing awareness of Giovanni's entanglements with other women, including the dancer Favorita and the Contessa Potensi, leads her to reevaluate her feelings.

The resolution of the Sansevero family's crisis comes through the intervention of John Derby, who uncovers the truth behind the painting's sale and clears Prince Alessandro's name. With the family's honor restored and the threat of scandal averted, Nina is free to choose her own path.

In the end, Nina's journey of self-discovery leads her to recognize her true feelings for John. Their shared values and deep connection offer a promise of genuine love and partnership, contrasting with the superficial allure of titles and wealth. The narrative closes with a sense of hope and renewal as Nina embraces a future that aligns with her heart's desires, leaving behind the intrigues of Roman society for a more authentic and fulfilling life.
