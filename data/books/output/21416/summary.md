Randy Thompson, a bright and industrious fourteen-year-old boy, lives in Riverport, a thriving town in an eastern state, with his parents, Louis and Mrs. Thompson. His father, a carpenter, is struggling with rheumatism, which limits his ability to work, and the family faces financial difficulties. Randy, eager to help, seeks advice from his Uncle Peter, a successful merchant in Deep Haven. Despite a cold reception from his aunt, Randy secures the use of a small farm and cottage owned by his uncle, which the family can occupy rent-free.

Randy, with the help of his friend Jack Bartlett, works diligently to make the farm livable and productive, hoping to alleviate some of the family's financial burdens. Meanwhile, Jack's father, Philip Bartlett, faces his own troubles. He has been ousted from his position at the local iron works by Amos Bangs, a wealthy and unscrupulous businessman, who has taken control of the company through deceitful means.

Randy's life takes a new turn when he saves a young girl, Helen Shalley, from drowning after an accident on the river. Her father, Andrew Shalley, a steamboat owner, offers Randy a job as a deckhand on his steamboat, the Helen Shalley. Randy accepts the position, eager to earn money to support his family. On the steamboat, Randy encounters various challenges, including dealing with the unpleasant purser, Peter Polk, who is later revealed to be involved in fraudulent activities.

During his time on the steamboat, Randy overhears a conversation between Amos Bangs and his associate, Tuller, discussing their schemes against Mr. Bartlett. Randy informs Mr. Bartlett, who, with the help of Mr. Robinson, another stockholder, plans to expose Bangs's fraudulent activities. Randy also discovers that Mrs. Bangs's servant, Mamie Jackson, has stolen important papers from the Bangs household, which could prove Bangs's wrongdoing. Randy and Mr. Bartlett retrieve the papers, leading to Bangs relinquishing control of the iron works.

Meanwhile, Randy's actions on the steamboat lead to the exposure of Peter Polk's embezzlement. With the help of a confession from George Gaffney, a clerk involved in the scheme, and evidence gathered by a detective hired by Mr. Shalley, Polk is arrested and convicted.

In gratitude for Randy's integrity and bravery, Andrew Shalley gifts Randy the deed to the farm, providing the Thompson family with a secure home. Mr. Bartlett, regaining control of the iron works, offers Randy's father a well-paying job, further securing the family's future. Randy returns home for the winter, focusing on his education alongside Jack Bartlett. As the years pass, Randy rises to become the general manager of the steamboat company, with a promising future ahead, and maintains his deep connection to his community and family.
