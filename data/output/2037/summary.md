The narrator of the story, upon deciding to write a novel, shares his intentions with his wife, Ethelbertha, who is initially supportive but becomes skeptical when she learns he plans to collaborate with his bachelor friends Jephson, Selkirk Brown, and Derrick MacShaughnassy. Ethelbertha harbors a prejudice against bachelors, believing them either intellectually weak or naturally depraved, unfit to be successful novelists. The narrator tries to convince her of the advantages of having multiple authors contribute their wit and wisdom to the novel, but her enthusiasm wanes.

The narrator reflects on his friend MacShaughnassy, who seems knowledgeable about everything but is often unreliable. Ethelbertha, when young and inexperienced in domestic affairs, was initially impressed by MacShaughnassy's advice but later became disillusioned with his impractical suggestions, like the method of laying fires or making coffee. MacShaughnassy's aunt also provides dubious advice, such as a recipe for exterminating black beetles, which only attracts more beetles rather than killing them.

The narrator shares a story about a man he met on an American train who, having once written a self-help book, is burdened by the consequences of his advice. The man recounts how he advised a simple-minded fellow, Josiah Hackett, on choosing a wife, leading to an unhappy marriage. Later, when Josiah seeks advice on investing money, the man reluctantly suggests a bank, which eventually fails. The man ends up supporting Josiah's large family, feeling responsible for their misfortunes.

The friends discuss what their novel's hero should be. MacShaughnassy suggests a soldier, based on various women's preferences for soldiers as ideal men due to their strength and appearance. The narrator shares anecdotes about soldiers' popularity among women, including a story of servant girls competing for soldiers' attention outside barracks.

The conversation shifts to selfishness, with Jephson arguing that all actions, good or bad, stem from selfishness. He shares a story about a man whose love for a woman leads him to save her husband from drowning, motivated by selfish reasons to avoid marrying her himself. MacShaughnassy tells a story about a mechanical dancer that causes chaos at a ball, illustrating the dangers of inventions.

The narrator's diary reveals the group's sporadic progress on the novel, with meetings often devolving into storytelling rather than productive work. The narrator reflects on his friendship with a man named Charley, who struggled with his nature and ultimately took his life, believing he could never truly reform. Jephson shares a story about a young Prussian officer who earns the Iron Cross through an act of bravery driven by fear, not heroism.

The group debates the possibility of a novel without a villain, concluding that crime and evil are essential for interesting stories. MacShaughnassy argues that literature and other professions depend on human misery, sharing anecdotes of people profiting from others' misfortunes.

The narrator shares stories told by a nurse, illustrating the complexities of human nature revealed in moments of crisis. One story involves a woman who uses her husband's delirium to uncover his affair, while another depicts a young couple's love tested by illness.

The group discusses the possibility of reforming their villain, Reuben Neil, through love. Brown is skeptical, while MacShaughnassy shares a story about a man with two contrasting personalities, illustrating the difficulty of changing one's nature. The story concludes with the group acknowledging the complexity of human character and the challenges of capturing it in their novel.
