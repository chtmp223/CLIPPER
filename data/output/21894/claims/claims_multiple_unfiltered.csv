2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the claim inaccurately describes the events. The situation does not escalate due to calm waters or a capsized ferry, as these details are not present in the chapter outline.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it introduces incorrect details and misrepresents the events.
