""White Fang develops howling as a means of communication with humans"": There is no mention in the chapter outline or book summary of White Fang developing howling as a means of communication with humans. Instead, the chapter outline mentions White Fang barking for the first time in the master's presence during a riding incident (event 4) and later barking to alert the family about the master's situation (event 6).
   b. ""first using it to warn the master's horse during a riding incident"": The chapter outline specifies that White Fang barks, not howls, to warn the master's horse during a riding incident (event 4).
   c. ""later to alert the family about the master's situation at home"": The chapter outline indicates that White Fang barks to communicate the master's situation to the family (event 6).

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid because the claim incorrectly states that White Fang uses howling, whereas the chapter outline specifies barking as the means of communication.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline, as it misrepresents the method of communication.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it contradicts the outlined events.

Since the claim misrepresents the method of communication and does not align with the chapter outline, it is INVALID."
