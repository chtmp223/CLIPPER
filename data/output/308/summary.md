The narrative begins with three friends, George, William Samuel Harris, and the unnamed narrator, along with Montmorency, a dog, discussing their various ailments and the pressures of their work life. They decide they need a break and contemplate a sea trip, but eventually agree on a boating journey along the River Thames. Despite Montmorency's objections, the plan is carried by a majority vote.

The journey begins in Kingston, where the friends embark on their adventure. As they travel, they encounter various humorous and challenging situations, such as dealing with tangled tow-lines and managing the boat. The narrative is interspersed with historical musings about the places they visit, such as Kingston and Hampton Court, and reflections on life and society.

Throughout the journey, the friends engage in various antics, including Harris's attempt to guide them through the Hampton Court Maze, which ends in comedic failure. They also encounter numerous characters, including a man who tries to extract a toll from them for trespassing and a series of people who claim to have caught a massive trout displayed in a local inn.

The friends' personalities and dynamics are a central theme, with Harris often taking charge, George being the practical one, and the narrator providing humorous commentary. Montmorency, the dog, adds to the chaos with his mischievous behavior.

As they progress, the friends face the challenges of camping out, dealing with inclement weather, and the complexities of river navigation. They also explore the towns and landmarks along the Thames, such as Dorchester, Abingdon, and Oxford, each with its own historical significance and charm.

The narrative is rich with humorous anecdotes, such as Harris's disastrous attempt at cooking scrambled eggs, and the group's interactions with the locals and each other. The journey is not just a physical one but also a reflection on friendship, the absurdities of life, and the simple pleasures of being in nature.

In the end, after enduring rain and mishaps, the friends decide to cut their trip short and return to London, where they enjoy a hearty supper and toast to their adventure. The story concludes with a reflection on the joys and trials of their journey, leaving the reader with a sense of camaraderie and the timeless appeal of a simple boating trip.
