The story begins with a mysterious duel between an Englishman and an American on the banks of the Niagara River, sparked by a disagreement over a mysterious sound heard in the sky. This sound, described differently by various listeners, has caused international intrigue and speculation. Observatories worldwide are baffled, and newspapers fuel the frenzy with sensational reports. Despite various theories, the source of the sound remains unidentified, until the observatories at Kautokeino and Isfjord report sighting an aerial object resembling a huge bird emitting explosive corpuscles.

Amidst this global mystery, the Weldon Institute in Philadelphia, a club dedicated to the advancement of balloon navigation, is embroiled in a heated debate over the placement of a screw for their new balloon, the "Go-Ahead." The club's president, Uncle Prudent, and secretary, Phil Evans, are fierce rivals. During a particularly tumultuous meeting, they are interrupted by Robur, an enigmatic engineer who challenges their belief in balloons, advocating instead for machines heavier than air.

Robur's interruption leads to chaos, and he is forced to flee. Later, Uncle Prudent, Phil Evans, and Prudent's valet, Frycollin, are kidnapped by Robur and taken aboard his flying machine, the "Albatross." The aeronef, powered by a secretive and powerful motor, defies the principles of lighter-than-air flight and demonstrates incredible speed and maneuverability. Robur intends to show his captives the superiority of his invention.

As the "Albatross" travels across North America, the captives are both amazed and infuriated by the machine's capabilities. Despite their awe, they remain determined to escape and destroy the aeronef. Their opportunity arises when the "Albatross" anchors at the Chatham Islands for repairs. Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans manage to escape, leaving behind a dynamite charge set to explode. They are rescued by island natives and eventually make their way back to the United States.

Meanwhile, Robur survives the explosion and reconstructs the "Albatross." He returns to Philadelphia just as the Weldon Institute is about to launch the "Go-Ahead." In a dramatic confrontation, Robur captures the balloonists but releases them after demonstrating the futility of their endeavors against his superior technology. He warns them of the premature pursuit of such technology and departs, taking his secret with him.

The story concludes with the Weldon Institute resuming its work on the "Go-Ahead," undeterred by their encounter with Robur. Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans, now free, choose not to disclose the full details of their adventure, leaving the world to wonder about the mysterious engineer and his flying machine. The narrative closes with Robur's promise that the secret of aerial navigation will one day belong to humanity when it is ready to use it wisely.
