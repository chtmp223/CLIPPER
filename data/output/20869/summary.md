Richard Seaton, a chemist, accidentally discovers a new source of energy by electrolyzing an unknown metal, "X." The metal's unique properties allow it to release intra-atomic energy, propelling a copper steam-bath out of his laboratory at high speed. Despite skepticism from his colleague, Ferdinand Scott, Seaton realizes the potential of his discovery: the ability to explore the solar system. With the financial backing of his millionaire friend, Martin Crane, Seaton resigns from his government position to develop this new technology.

Dr. Marc DuQuesne, a rival chemist, becomes aware of Seaton's discovery and its potential. He approaches the World Steel Corporation, suggesting they steal Seaton's solution to monopolize the new energy source. Despite initial failures, DuQuesne and the corporation are determined to acquire the technology, even considering murder to achieve their goals.

Seaton and Crane, unaware of DuQuesne's machinations, work tirelessly to develop a space-faring vehicle, the "Skylark." Seaton's fianc√©e, Dorothy Vaneman, and Crane's friend, Margaret Spencer, become involved in the adventure. As Seaton and Crane prepare for their first test flight, DuQuesne kidnaps Dorothy, intending to use her as leverage to force Seaton to surrender his discoveries.

DuQuesne's plan goes awry when the space-car carrying Dorothy and other captives, including Margaret, spirals out of control, traveling billions of miles into space. Seaton and Crane, using their own Skylark, pursue the abductors, following a trail across the universe. They eventually rescue the captives from a massive, dark star that threatens to consume them.

During their journey, Seaton and Crane encounter a planet inhabited by a technologically advanced but morally ambiguous race. The planet's ruler, Nalboon, initially welcomes the Earthlings but soon reveals treacherous intentions. With the help of Dunark, a prince from a rival nation, Seaton and Crane escape Nalboon's clutches and forge an alliance with Dunark's people.

In a climactic battle, Seaton uses the Skylark's superior technology to defeat Nalboon's forces, securing peace for Dunark's nation. In gratitude, Dunark provides Seaton and Crane with vast quantities of platinum and other resources, ensuring their return to Earth.

Back on Earth, Seaton and Crane contemplate their next steps, aware that DuQuesne remains at large, a potential threat. However, they are confident in their ability to protect their discoveries and loved ones from any future danger. The adventure solidifies the bonds between Seaton, Crane, Dorothy, and Margaret, as they look forward to a new era of exploration and discovery.
