In a thrilling narrative set against the backdrop of space exploration, the story follows the Space Cadets—Tom Corbett, Roger Manning, and Astro—on a mission that tests their skills and integrity. The cadets are part of the pioneering expedition to establish the first star colony on Roald, a satellite orbiting the distant sun star Wolf 359. The expedition is led by Governor Christopher Hardy, with Lieutenant Governor Paul Vidac as his second-in-command. The mission is fraught with challenges, including a vast fleet of a thousand spaceships carrying eager colonists ready to start anew.

The cadets, known for their exceptional abilities and teamwork, are tasked with screening applicants for the colony. Despite their rigorous selection process, they become suspicious of Vidac, who has a questionable background and seems to be manipulating the selection of colonists by allowing dubious characters like Tad Winters and Ed Bush to join the expedition. Vidac's actions raise concerns, especially when the cadets' reports to Captain Steve Strong, their mentor and a respected Solar Guard officer, go unanswered.

As the fleet embarks on its journey, the cadets are assigned various duties, including assisting the irascible Professor Barnard Sykes in charting unexplored regions of space. Tensions rise when Vidac orders the cadets to scout a dangerous asteroid cluster at full speed, risking their lives. The cadets' suspicions deepen when they learn that Vidac has been exploiting the colonists, forcing them to pay for food and essentials under the guise of rationing.

The cadets attempt to build a secret communicator to contact Space Academy and expose Vidac's schemes. However, Vidac discovers their plan and destroys the device, further isolating them. Despite the challenges, the cadets remain determined to find a way to alert their superiors about Vidac's treachery.

In a dramatic turn, the cadets are sent on a perilous mission through the asteroid cluster. They manage to navigate the hazards but find no safe passage for the fleet, confirming their earlier reports. Upon their return, Vidac accuses them of shirking their duties, but the cadets stand firm in their findings. Meanwhile, Jeff Marshall, Professor Sykes's aide and an ally of the cadets, is caught trying to access the ship's logbook and is confined to the brig, raising further suspicions about Vidac's control over communications.

The narrative reaches a climax when the cadets, realizing the full extent of Vidac's corruption, decide to confront Governor Hardy directly. They are determined to uncover the truth and protect the colonists from Vidac's exploitation. With Captain Strong absent on a mission to Pluto, the cadets must rely on their wits and courage to navigate the political and personal challenges posed by the treacherous Vidac.

Throughout the story, themes of loyalty, justice, and the pioneering spirit of exploration are explored as the cadets strive to uphold the values of the Solar Guard. Their journey is not only a physical voyage across space but also a moral quest to ensure the success of the star colony on Roald and to safeguard the future of human expansion into the cosmos.
