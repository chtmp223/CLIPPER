Seth Atkins, the keeper of Eastboro Twin-Lights, is a solitary figure living on a desolate stretch of Cape Cod. His life is disrupted when he discovers a stranger washed ashore near the lighthouse. The stranger, who introduces himself as John Brown, is a young man who fell overboard from a steamer. Despite his mysterious past and reluctance to divulge personal details, Brown is taken in by Seth and becomes his assistant. The two men form an uneasy alliance, each hiding their own secrets and pasts.

Seth, a former sea captain, is a self-proclaimed woman-hater, a sentiment stemming from his troubled marriage to a woman named Emeline. He left her after a series of misunderstandings and disputes involving her brother-in-law, Bennie D., who manipulated and caused discord in their marriage. Seth has since sought refuge in the isolation of the lighthouse, away from women and society.

Brown, on the other hand, is also escaping from his past. He is the disinherited son of a wealthy man, having left his privileged life after refusing an arranged marriage to a girl he did not love. His fall overboard was both literal and metaphorical, representing his break from his former life. He finds solace in the anonymity of the lighthouse, though he struggles with his own loneliness and the monotony of the job.

The arrival of two women at a nearby bungalow—Ruth Graham, an artist, and her housekeeper, Mrs. Bascom—complicates matters. Brown, despite his vow to avoid women, finds himself drawn to Ruth. Their initial encounters are marked by mutual curiosity and a developing friendship, which challenges Brown's resolve to remain detached.

Seth, meanwhile, is shocked to discover that Mrs. Bascom is none other than his estranged wife, Emeline. This revelation forces him to confront his past and the unresolved issues in his marriage. Emeline, who had been living separately, is also taken aback by the encounter but still harbors feelings for Seth.

As the story unfolds, both men grapple with their pasts and the women who inadvertently become part of their lives. Seth, despite his bluster, is revealed to be a man yearning for connection and redemption. Brown, initially intent on hiding from the world, begins to reconsider his isolation as he grows closer to Ruth.

The narrative explores themes of redemption, the complexity of human relationships, and the struggle between past grievances and the possibility of new beginnings. In the end, Seth and Brown must decide whether to continue running from their pasts or to embrace the chance for reconciliation and change offered by the women who have entered their lives. The lighthouse, a symbol of isolation, becomes a place of potential renewal and hope for both men.
