Elizabeth Ann, a delicate and timid nine-year-old girl, lives with her Great-aunt Harriet, Aunt Frances, and their housekeeper Grace in a medium-sized city. Elizabeth Ann's parents died when she was a baby, and the two aunts, believing themselves to be the best caretakers for her sensitive nature, took her in. However, Aunt Harriet falls seriously ill, and circumstances force Elizabeth Ann to be sent to live with other relatives, the Putneys, whom she has been taught to fear as cold and unsympathetic.

Upon arriving at the Putney Farm in Vermont, Elizabeth Ann is greeted by her Uncle Henry, Aunt Abigail, and Cousin Ann. The farm is a stark contrast to her previous life, with its simple, hardworking environment. Initially frightened and homesick, she gradually adapts to her new surroundings.

Although their plan doesn't go as expected, 'Lias is ultimately adopted by a kind man named Mr. Pond, thanks to Betsy's and her friends' efforts.
