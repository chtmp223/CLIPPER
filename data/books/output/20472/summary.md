In a small town called Oakdale, a new school year begins at Oakdale High School, where the freshmen girls are eager to make their mark. Grace Harlowe, a spirited and kind-hearted leader, is at the center of the social scene, along with her close friends Jessica Bright, Nora O'Malley, and the shy, intelligent Anne Pierson. Anne, who comes from a poor background, quickly becomes the focus of both admiration and jealousy due to her academic prowess, making her a rival to the wealthy and haughty Miriam Nesbit.

The story unfolds as Grace, determined to foster inclusivity and friendship, invites Anne into her social circle, despite Miriam's disdain. The girls navigate the challenges of high school life, from class elections to social gatherings, with Grace often standing up for Anne against Miriam's snobbishness. The setting is Oakdale, a town that prides itself on its twin high schools and their athletic and academic achievements.

Amidst the school dynamics, a significant subplot emerges involving Anne's troubled family life. Her father, a failed actor, reappears with demands that threaten Anne's stability and future. Meanwhile, the girls are drawn into various adventures, including a memorable nutting party that is disrupted by sophomores disguised as the "Black Monks of Asia," and a daring plan to crash the sophomores' secret masquerade ball.

As the year progresses, the narrative weaves through the excitement of Thanksgiving Day, with its traditional football game, and the challenges of the classroom, particularly with the unpleasant Miss Leece, who seems to have a vendetta against Anne. The climax of the academic year is the competition for the freshman prize, which Anne is determined to win to help her family financially.

The story reaches a turning point when Anne's father attempts to force her into a life she doesn't want, leading to a dramatic rescue by her friends. Grace's leadership and the unwavering support of her friends highlight themes of loyalty, courage, and the power of friendship.

In the end, Anne's hard work pays off as she wins not only the freshman prize but also the admiration and respect of her peers. The book closes with the promise of continued adventures for Grace and her friends as they prepare for their sophomore year, having learned valuable lessons about integrity, perseverance, and the importance of standing by those you care about.
