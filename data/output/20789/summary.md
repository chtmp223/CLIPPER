In a small town, a group of boys from the Central Grammar School, known as Dick & Co., embark on a winter camping adventure in a log cabin located in a forest. The group consists of Dick Prescott, Dave Darrin, Greg Holmes, Dan Dalzell, Tom Reade, and Harry Hazelton. They are joined unexpectedly by Hen Dutcher, a less popular and often troublesome peer, who seeks shelter from a snowstorm.

As the boys settle into their cabin, they encounter a mysterious figure known as Mr. Fits, a thief who has been causing trouble in their town. Fits attempts to take over the cabin, but the boys manage to send him to a nearby shack, maintaining control of their temporary home. During their stay, the boys discover a hidden stash of stolen goods buried under the cabin floor, revealing Mr. Fits's past crimes.

The boys face further challenges when Fred Ripley, a high school student with a grudge against them, arrives with his gang to disrupt their peace. A confrontation ensues, resulting in the accidental burning of the cook shack. Despite these challenges, the boys manage to hold their ground and continue their camping experience, learning valuable lessons about teamwork and resilience.

The story takes a turn when the boys return to their town, only to find that Mr. Fits is still at large. Dick and Dave encounter him on the street, leading to a chase that ultimately involves their school principal, Mr. E. Dutton Jones, who helps apprehend the thief. Mr. Fits is brought to justice, and the stolen goods are returned to their rightful owners.

Throughout their adventure, Dick & Co. navigate the challenges of friendship, loyalty, and courage, earning the respect of their peers and community. The story concludes with the boys returning to school, ready to share their experiences and continue their journey of growth and learning.
