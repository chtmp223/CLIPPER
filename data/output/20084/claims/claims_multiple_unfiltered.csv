   a. ""The white yacht Gaston de Paris, spotted by the Albatross crew running under bare poles"": This part is grounded in event 5 of Chapter 2, where the crew of the Albatross spots the Gaston de Paris running under bare poles.

   b. ""later rescues the Albatross in the darkness"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline or the book summary. There is no mention of the Gaston de Paris rescuing the Albatross. Instead, the summary describes a collision between the two ships, resulting in the sinking of both vessels.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not meaningful or valid, as the events described do not occur in the narrative. The Gaston de Paris does not rescue the Albatross; rather, both ships are involved in a collision.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship contradicts the information provided in the book summary and chapter outline, as the collision leads to the sinking of both ships, not a rescue.

   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the claim contradicts the events described in the book summary and chapter outline. The Gaston de Paris does not safely pass the Albatross; instead, they collide.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it contradicts the described events.

Instead, the outline describes a confrontation where La Touche attempts to assert dominance, and the protagonist threatens him with a knife (Chapter 13, event 4). This suggests a tense relationship rather than a friendly one.
   b. ""the woman accidentally kills him during a hunting expedition"": The chapter outline does not mention a hunting expedition.
