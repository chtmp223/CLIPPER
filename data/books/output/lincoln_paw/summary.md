Miss Susan Baird, a stern and eccentric woman living in Georgetown, is found dead in her library. Her niece, Kitty Baird, who has been living with her, is shocked to learn that her aunt has been poisoned with prussic acid. The police, led by Inspector Mitchell, begin an investigation into her death, which appears to be a case of murder rather than suicide, despite initial suspicions. The investigation reveals that Miss Baird was a secretive miser who had amassed a fortune, which she left to Kitty in a will hidden in a series of secret compartments throughout the house.

Kitty, devastated by her aunt's death, finds support from her godfather, Charles Craige, and Edward Rodgers, a handwriting expert who is deeply in love with her. The investigation uncovers that Kitty and her aunt had quarreled over Major Leigh Wallace, a suitor whom Miss Baird disapproved of. Kitty is suspected of being involved in her aunt's death due to her inheritance and the quarrel, but she vehemently denies any wrongdoing.

The inquest reveals that the peaches Miss Baird was eating were poisoned, and only one side of the knife used to cut them was tainted, suggesting a deliberate act by someone who was with Miss Baird. Oscar, the loyal servant, testifies that he did not buy the peaches, adding to the mystery.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Amos Parsons, Kitty's employer, harbors her suspicions about Edward Rodgers, believing he might be an adventurer involved in a past forgery case related to Colonel Holt's will, which had left Leigh Wallace a fortune. She shares her concerns with Inspector Mitchell, who takes the information seriously, especially considering that both Rodgers and Wallace are connected to the Baird case.

As the investigation progresses, it becomes clear that Charles Craige is not just a friend but a suspect. His actions, including his attempt to frame Kitty and his involvement in the poisoning, are uncovered. Craige confesses to the murder, driven by financial desperation and a desire to marry Kitty to cover up his forgery of Miss Baird's financial documents.

The resolution of the case brings relief to Kitty, who inherits her auntâ€™s wealth legitimately. The mystery of Miss Baird's death is solved, revealing a web of deceit and greed, with Craige as the mastermind behind the murder. Kitty, supported by Edward Rodgers, looks forward to a future free from the shadows cast by her aunt's tragic death.
