The narrative begins with the protagonist, a traveler from the United States, who recounts his experiences after descending into the depths of the earth through a mine. He is introduced to a subterranean world inhabited by a race known as the Vril-ya. This society is advanced and possesses a mysterious energy source called "vril," which grants them extraordinary powers over nature and life itself. The protagonist is taken in by a family led by Aph-Lin, who provides him with shelter and guidance in understanding the customs and technologies of the Vril-ya.

The Vril-ya society is depicted as a utopia where war, crime, and poverty are nonexistent. They live in harmony, governed by a benevolent autocracy that values unity and order. The protagonist learns that the Vril-ya have evolved from humans who once lived above ground but were forced to retreat into the earth due to cataclysmic events. Over generations, they developed the vril energy, which they use for everything from healing to construction and even destruction if necessary.

The protagonist's host, Aph-Lin, and his daughter, Zee, are central characters who help him navigate this new world. Zee, a learned and powerful Gy (female), takes a particular interest in the protagonist, leading to a complex relationship marked by cultural misunderstandings and romantic tension. Despite her affection, the protagonist is wary of her advances, aware that societal norms among the Vril-ya allow Gy-ei to choose their partners, a dynamic unfamiliar and unsettling to him.

Throughout his stay, the protagonist grapples with the philosophical and ethical implications of the Vril-ya's way of life. He admires their peace and technological prowess but is troubled by their potential for destruction and the lack of individual ambition or desire for fame, which are integral to human progress as he knows it. His discomfort is compounded by the realization that his presence, if discovered by the wider community, could lead to his death to prevent any threat to their society.

As he contemplates his situation, the protagonist is struck by the stark differences between the Vril-ya and his own world. The Vril-ya's serene existence, devoid of strife and competition, contrasts sharply with the chaotic and competitive nature of human societies. Yet, he longs for the familiar unpredictability and freedom of his own world, despite its flaws.

Ultimately, the protagonist's desire to return to the surface intensifies. Zee, understanding his plight, offers to help him escape, even at the cost of leaving her own world. However, he declines, recognizing the impossibility of merging their worlds and the potential danger her presence would pose above ground. In a final act of compassion, Zee assists him in reaching the surface, ensuring his safe departure from the subterranean realm.

The story concludes with the protagonist reflecting on his experiences and the profound impact they have had on his understanding of civilization and human nature. He records his journey as a warning of the potential threat the Vril-ya pose to humanity, should they ever choose to emerge from their hidden world.
