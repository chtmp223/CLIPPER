2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not meaningful or valid because the chapter outline does not support the claim that K. leaves satisfied. The chapter ends abruptly with no indication of K.'s satisfaction or departure.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not contradict any information in the summary, but it is not supported by the chapter outline.

Since 1b., 2a., and 2b. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The sequence of events is logical: K. arrives at the cathedral, and since the Italian business contact does not show up, he explores the building.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation or assumption; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
