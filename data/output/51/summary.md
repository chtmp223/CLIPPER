Anne Shirley, now a college student at Redmond, is navigating the complexities of young adulthood, friendships, and romantic entanglements. As she embarks on this new chapter, Anne finds herself in the company of her friends Priscilla Grant and Philippa Gordon. The trio, along with their other classmates, immerse themselves in the academic and social life at Redmond, forming bonds and experiencing the highs and lows of college life.

Anne's journey is peppered with moments of introspection and self-discovery. She grapples with her feelings for Gilbert Blythe, her childhood friend, who has matured into a thoughtful and accomplished young man. Despite their close friendship, Anne is uncertain about her feelings, especially when faced with the attention of other suitors like the charming Roy Gardner. Anne's internal conflict reaches a climax when she realizes that her affection for Roy is not as deep as she once believed, leading to a painful but necessary decision to end their courtship.

The narrative also explores Anne's friendships, particularly with Philippa, whose vivacious personality and romantic escapades provide both amusement and insight into the different paths young women might take. Philippa's engagement to Jonas Blake, a divinity student, contrasts with Anne's more introspective journey toward understanding her own heart.

Anne's connection to her past and her home in Avonlea remains strong throughout her college years. Letters from home, filled with news and gossip from familiar faces like Marilla, Mrs. Lynde, and the mischievous Davy, keep Anne grounded. These letters remind her of the life she temporarily left behind and the enduring relationships that continue to shape her.

As Anne approaches the end of her college years, she faces the prospect of her future with both excitement and trepidation. The possibility of renting "Patty's Place," a charming house near Redmond, with Priscilla and Philippa, offers a glimpse of independence and the continuation of their shared adventures.

Ultimately, Anne's journey is one of growth and self-awareness. Through her experiences at Redmond, she learns to distinguish between fleeting infatuations and enduring love, setting the stage for her eventual realization of her true feelings for Gilbert. As she prepares to leave college, Anne carries with her the lessons of friendship, love, and the knowledge that life's path is often unpredictable but always filled with the potential for joy and fulfillment.
