In a dreary London club on a rainy February afternoon, Mrs. Wilkins, a timid, neglected housewife, discovers an advertisement in The Times for a small medieval Italian castle available for rent. The ad promises sunshine and wistaria, sparking a longing in her for escape and beauty. She shares the idea with Mrs. Arbuthnot, a fellow club member and a woman similarly weighed down by her own burdens, including a distant husband and a life dominated by charitable work. Together, they decide to rent the castle for the month of April, using their savings, despite the daunting cost and the need for references.

To share the expense, they advertise for two more women to join them. They are soon joined by Lady Caroline Dester, a beautiful and wealthy young woman seeking solitude from her social obligations, and Mrs. Fisher, an elderly widow who longs to reminisce in peace about her illustrious Victorian acquaintances. The four women, each from different backgrounds and with different reasons for escape, set off for Italy.

Upon arrival at the enchanting San Salvatore, each woman begins to experience a transformation. Mrs. Wilkins blossoms in the Italian sunshine, shedding her fears and gaining confidence and joy. Mrs. Arbuthnot, too, starts to let go of her self-imposed martyrdom and begins to dream of reconnecting with her estranged husband, Frederick. Lady Caroline, initially aloof and seeking isolation, finds herself drawn into the warmth and camaraderie of the group. Even the stern and reserved Mrs. Fisher softens, touched by the beauty around her and the kindness of her companions.

The castle itself, with its gardens full of flowers and its views over the Mediterranean, becomes a character in its own right, working its magic on the women. They find themselves relaxing, laughing, and forming unexpected friendships. The atmosphere of San Salvatore acts as a catalyst for change, allowing each woman to confront her past and consider her future.

As the days pass, the womenâ€™s lives intertwine in unexpected ways. Mrs. Wilkins, who had feared her husband Mellersh's reaction to her escapade, finds him arriving at the castle, transformed by the place and eager to rekindle their marriage. Mrs. Arbuthnot, encouraged by her surroundings and the support of her new friends, writes to Frederick, inviting him to join her. When he arrives, they find a new understanding and love for each other.

Lady Caroline, known as Scrap, finds herself admired by Mr. Briggs, the owner of the castle, who is captivated by her beauty and spirit. Though initially resistant to his attentions, Scrap begins to see the value in genuine affection and companionship. Mrs. Fisher, meanwhile, opens up to the possibility of friendship and joy, finding a new lease on life in the company of her fellow tenants.

By the end of their stay, each woman has been transformed by the magic of San Salvatore. They leave the castle not only rested and rejuvenated but also with a renewed sense of purpose and connection. The experience has given them the courage to face their lives anew, armed with the happiness and insights gained during their month in the Italian sunshine.

The novel concludes with a sense of hope and renewal, as the women return to their lives, forever changed by their time at San Salvatore. The castle, with its beauty and tranquility, has worked its magic, leaving them with the realization that happiness and love are within their reach.
