- Chapter 15, item 2: The narrator deliberately wounds the earl non-fatally and, with the steward's help, places him in a boat to escape.
- Relationship: Cassilis's plan to save the Earl is executed on the beach.",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""Cassilis's plan to save the Earl involves moving their duel to the beach"": This part is grounded in Chapter 14, where Cassilis proposes moving the duel to the beach and devises a plan to save the Earl.
    b. ""he deliberately wounds the Earl non-fatally"": This part is grounded in Chapter 15, where the narrator (Cassilis) deliberately wounds the Earl non-fatally during their duel on the beach.
    c. ""helps him escape by boat"": This part is grounded in Chapter 15, where the narrator, with the steward's help, places the Earl in a boat to escape.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. Cassilis's actions are part of a coherent plan to save the Earl, which involves moving the duel to the beach, wounding him non-fatally, and facilitating his escape by boat.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly supported by the chapter outline.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it aligns with Cassilis's character and his internal conflict between duty and personal feelings.

Since all atomic parts are grounded in the chapter outline and the relationship between them is valid and meaningful, the claim is consistent with the provided information.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""Cassilis's plan to save the Earl involves moving their duel to the woods"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The outline specifies that the duel is moved to the beach, not the woods (Chapter 14, event 6).
    b. ""he deliberately wounds the Earl non-fatally"": This part is grounded in Chapter 15, event 2, where the narrator (Cassilis) wounds the Earl non-fatally.
    c. ""helps him escape on horseback"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The outline indicates that the Earl is placed in a boat to escape, not on horseback (Chapter 15, event 2).

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not valid because the claim contains incorrect details about the location of the duel and the method of escape, which are not supported by the chapter outline.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it introduces incorrect details.

Since parts 1a. and 1c. are not satisfied, and the relationship in 2a. is not valid, the claim is INVALID."
"The hidden path leading up the cliff face, discovered during the initial approach to Cleeve Manor, is later used by the group to return to the manor house after the beach confrontation.","The hidden path leading up the cliff face, discovered during the initial approach to Cleeve Manor, is later used by the group to escape from the manor house.","In Chapter 1, the group discovers a hidden path leading up the cliff face during their initial approach to Cleeve Manor. This same path is used again in Chapter 15 when the group, including the narrator and the Dutch dragoons, ascends the cliff path to return to the manor house after the confrontation on the beach. This demonstrates the recurring importance of this specific geographical feature in the story.","The corrupted fact incorrectly states that the path is used to escape from the manor house, while in reality, it is used to return to the manor house after the beach confrontation.","Chapter 1, 15","- Chapter 1, item 6: They discover a boat and a hidden path leading up the cliff face.
- Chapter 15, item 4: The group ascends the cliff path and returns to the manor house.
- Relationship: The same cliff path is used in different contexts.",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""The hidden path leading up the cliff face, discovered during the initial approach to Cleeve Manor"": This part is grounded in event 6 of Chapter 1, where the group discovers a hidden path leading up the cliff face.
   b. ""is later used by the group to return to the manor house after the beach confrontation"": This part is grounded in event 6 of Chapter 15, where the group ascends the cliff path and returns to the manor house.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The claim connects the discovery of the path in Chapter 1 with its later use in Chapter 15, indicating a continuity in the narrative.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is based on the events described in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline. There is no contradicting information, and the use of the path aligns with the events described.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""The hidden path leading up the cliff face, discovered during the initial approach to Cleeve Manor"": This part is grounded in event 6 of Chapter 1, where the group discovers a hidden path leading up the cliff face.
    b. ""is later used by the group to escape from the manor house"": There is no mention in Chapter 15 of the group using the hidden path to escape from the manor house.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not objectively valid because there is no explicit connection in the chapter outline or summary that the hidden path discovered in Chapter 1 is used for escape in Chapter 15.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not contradict any information in the summary or outline, but it lacks explicit support.
