   a. ""Violet Forster, who met Sydney Beaton at a summer house on the Nuthurst estate"": This part is grounded in event 5 of Chapter 2, where Violet meets Sydney at a summer house on the Nuthurst estate.
   b. ""later informs her uncle of her intention to marry Sydney and stay at Nuthurst"": This part is partially grounded in event 2 of Chapter 23, where Violet informs her uncle of her intention to marry Sydney.

   c. ""subsequently moves to Cobden Mansions in London"": This part is grounded in event 3 of Chapter 23, where Violet moves to a flat in London at Cobden Mansions.
   d. ""while successfully searching for him"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline or summary. In Chapter 24, Violet reflects on her unsuccessful search for Sydney, indicating that she has not yet found him.
