In the late 19th century, Dr. John Watson, a close associate of the renowned detective Sherlock Holmes, recounts a gripping tale set in the eerie moors of Devonshire. The story begins with the mysterious death of Sir Charles Baskerville, a wealthy baronet whose demise is linked to the legendary curse of a supernatural hound haunting his family. Dr. James Mortimer, a friend and physician to Sir Charles, seeks Holmes' expertise to protect the last heir, Sir Henry Baskerville, who is returning from Canada to inherit the Baskerville estate.

Holmes, intrigued by the case, sends Watson to accompany Sir Henry to Baskerville Hall, while he remains in London to investigate further. Watson is tasked with observing the people surrounding Sir Henry and reporting back any suspicious activity. Upon arrival, Watson encounters the Barrymores, the long-serving butler and his wife, whose behavior raises suspicions. Watson also meets the Stapletons, naturalist Jack Stapleton and his sister Beryl, who live nearby. Beryl warns Watson of the dangers lurking on the moor, hinting at the supernatural threat.

As Watson delves deeper, he discovers a series of peculiar events. Barrymore is seen signaling with a candle from a window at night, and it is revealed that he is secretly aiding his brother-in-law, Selden, a convict hiding on the moor. Meanwhile, Sir Henry becomes romantically interested in Beryl Stapleton, but her brother Jack vehemently opposes the relationship, leading to a tense confrontation.

Watson's investigation is further complicated by the presence of a mysterious figure on the moor, whom he spots one night. This figure, he later learns, is Holmes himself, who has been secretly investigating the case. Holmes deduces that Jack Stapleton is actually a Baskerville and has been orchestrating the legend of the hound to eliminate Sir Henry and claim the inheritance for himself. Stapleton has been using a large, trained dog, painted with phosphorus to appear spectral, to frighten Sir Charles to death and now plans to do the same to Sir Henry.

In a climactic confrontation, Holmes, Watson, and Inspector Lestrade set a trap for Stapleton. As Sir Henry walks home from a dinner at Merripit House, Stapleton unleashes the hound. Holmes and Watson manage to kill the beast, saving Sir Henry. They discover that Stapleton has fled into the deadly Grimpen Mire, where he presumably meets his end.

The mystery resolved, Holmes explains the intricacies of Stapleton's plot, revealing his true identity and his motive to inherit the Baskerville fortune. The case concludes with Sir Henry recovering from the ordeal, and Watson returning to London with Holmes, their friendship and partnership stronger than ever. The tale of the Hound of the Baskervilles remains one of their most challenging and memorable cases, blending elements of gothic horror with the sharp deductive reasoning for which Holmes is famous.
