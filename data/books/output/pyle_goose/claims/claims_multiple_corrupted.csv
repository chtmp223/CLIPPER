   c. ""who then gives Ellen a magic wand as a gift"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The outline states that the huntsman gives Ellen a horn, not a magic wand, as a gift.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship between the first two parts is valid and meaningful, as informing the huntsman follows the trapping of the wolf.
   b. The relationship between the second and third parts is not valid because the chapter outline specifies that the huntsman gives Ellen a horn, not a magic wand. This discrepancy makes the claim inconsistent with the provided information.
   c. The relationship does not contradict the summary, but it does contradict the chapter outline regarding the specific gift given by the huntsman.

Since part 1c is not satisfied due to the inconsistency with the chapter outline, the claim is INVALID."
