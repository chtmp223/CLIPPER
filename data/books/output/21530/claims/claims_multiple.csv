- Relationship: Jean's manipulation of Mordon and evidence creation",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Jean Briggerland manipulates Mordon into delivering a forged letter and cheque from Lydia to London"": This part is grounded in Chapter 29, where Jean forges a letter and cheque from Lydia, which Mordon delivers to London via Paris.
