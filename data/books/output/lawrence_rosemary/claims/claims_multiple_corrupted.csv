""she admits to not preparing properly when discussing the incident with Miss Parsons"": The chapter outline mentions Rosemary discussing the soup incident with Miss Parsons in event 5 of Chapter 17, but it does not specify that she admits to not preparing the chicken properly. The discussion is about the soup, not chicken.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid because the claim introduces an event (undercooked chicken) that is not supported by the chapter outline.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the issue discussed is with the soup, not chicken.
