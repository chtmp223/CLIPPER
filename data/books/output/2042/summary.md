Ashe Marson, a young American living in London, finds himself in a rut, working as a writer of detective stories for a publishing company. One day, he encounters Joan Valentine, a spirited and resourceful young woman who encourages him to seek adventure. Inspired, Ashe answers an advertisement seeking a "young man of good appearance" for a "delicate and dangerous" job. The job, as it turns out, involves recovering a valuable scarab that has been stolen from J. Preston Peters, an American millionaire and collector.

Mr. Peters believes that the scarab, a prized piece from his collection, has been taken by Lord Emsworth, the absent-minded owner of Blandings Castle, where Peters is staying. Ashe is hired to pose as Peters' valet and retrieve the scarab without attracting attention. Meanwhile, Joan Valentine, an old school friend of Peters' daughter Aline, is also at the castle, working as Aline's maid. Unknown to Ashe, Joan has the same mission: to recover the scarab for the reward offered by Peters.

Ashe and Joan form an uneasy alliance, agreeing to work together and split the reward. However, they are not the only ones interested in the scarab. The castle's efficient but suspicious secretary, Rupert Baxter, is also on high alert, having noticed strange occurrences and suspecting foul play. Baxter's vigilance makes Ashe and Joan's task more challenging.

The castle is filled with a colorful cast of characters, including the Honorable Freddie Threepwood, Lord Emsworth's son, who is engaged to Aline Peters. Freddie, however, is more interested in his own escapades and is oblivious to the intrigue surrounding the scarab. George Emerson, a friend of Aline's and secretly in love with her, is also staying at the castle, adding to the complications.

Ashe and Joan navigate the complexities of life below stairs, with Ashe learning the intricacies of servant etiquette and Joan using her charm and wit to gather information. Despite several close calls with Baxter, they manage to locate the scarab in the castle's museum. However, retrieving it proves difficult, as Baxter's suspicions lead him to keep a close watch on the museum.

In a series of comedic misadventures, Ashe and Joan attempt to outwit Baxter and secure the scarab. Their efforts are complicated by a series of misunderstandings and the interference of other guests, including Freddie, who unwittingly becomes involved in the chaos. Throughout, Ashe and Joan's relationship develops from rivalry to friendship, with a hint of romance.

The story reaches a climax when Baxter, convinced of Ashe's guilt, confronts him in the museum. Ashe manages to deflect suspicion with a clever ruse, leaving Baxter frustrated and bewildered. In the end, Joan successfully retrieves the scarab, proving her resourcefulness and earning the reward. Ashe, having found the adventure he sought, decides to pursue a new path in life, inspired by his experiences at Blandings Castle.

The novel concludes with the various characters' relationships and futures resolved, as Ashe and Joan look forward to new adventures together, hinting at a possible romantic future. The comedic elements, colorful characters, and lively dialogue make for an entertaining story of intrigue and romance set against the backdrop of an English country house.
