2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship between the professor's actions and Tom discovering the supplies and taking charge is not directly meaningful or causal. The claim suggests a sequence of events, but it does not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the professor's drunken actions and Tom's subsequent actions.
