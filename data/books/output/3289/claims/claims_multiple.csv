    b. ""for ordering the attack on Editor James Stanger of the Herald newspaper"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline or the book summary. The chapter outline specifies that McGinty orders the attack on James Stanger (event 5 of Chapter 10), and McMurdo participates in the attack (event 6 of Chapter 10), but there is no mention of McMurdo ordering the attack.

    a. The relationship is not valid because the claim incorrectly attributes the ordering of the attack to McMurdo and the execution of the attack to McGinty, which contradicts the chapter outline.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it misrepresents the roles of McMurdo and McGinty in the attack on Stanger.

   c. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation but is contradicted by the chapter outline.

Since the third atomic part contradicts the chapter outline, the claim is INVALID."
