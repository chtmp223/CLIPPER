Cub Perry, along with his friends Bud Taylor and Hal Stone, are three adventurous boys from Oswego, New York, who are passionate about radio technology. As their summer vacation begins, they find themselves with ample free time and decide to embark on an exciting adventure. The trio is intrigued by a mysterious radio distress signal they receive from someone claiming to be marooned on an island in the Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence River. The sender, who identifies himself as "V A X," claims to have been left stranded by lake thieves who stole his boat, leaving him with only a radio set and limited food.

Eager to help and driven by curiosity, the boys decide to organize a rescue mission. They plan to use Cub's family motorboat, the Catwhisker, to navigate the lake and locate the distressed radio operator. The boys' enthusiasm is tempered by skepticism from an anonymous radio operator who claims the distress call is a hoax and part of a wager between two radio enthusiasts. Despite this, Cub's father, Mr. Perry, supports the boys' plan and agrees to accompany them on their adventure.

Equipped with a radio compass and Hal's portable radio set, the group sets out on the Catwhisker. They navigate through the Thousand Islands, using radio signals to guide them. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and conflicting messages, including an ominous warning from the mysterious operator who persists in trying to dissuade them from their mission.

As the boys venture deeper into the islands, they receive a series of confusing messages from the alleged castaway, who claims to see them approaching but then warns of menacing figures coming ashore. The situation becomes more perplexing when the supposed castaway suddenly sends a final message, declaring the entire affair a hoax and admitting to a wager with the other operator.

Despite the revelation, the boys remain determined to uncover the truth. They employ their radio compass to triangulate the location of the original distress signals, leading them to an island where they believe the castaway was broadcasting. Their efforts are bolstered by assistance from other radio enthusiasts who have been following their progress and offer information to help pinpoint the island.

The mystery deepens when the boys discover that the sender of the distress signal might be Hal's cousin, Alvin Baker, a student at Edwards College. Alvin had been the victim of a college hazing prank, marooned on the island by sophomores, but the situation escalated when he was captured by a group of criminals using the island as a hideout for smuggling stolen goods.

The adventure reaches its climax as the boys, with the help of a Canadian government officer, locate and raid the hideout, rescuing Alvin and apprehending the criminals. The revelation that Alvin's hazing prank had inadvertently led to his capture by the smugglers adds a layer of complexity to the story.

In the end, the boys' adventure proves to be a thrilling success. They not only solve the mystery of the radio distress call but also assist in dismantling a criminal operation. The experience strengthens their friendship and cements their reputation as resourceful and courageous young adventurers. Mr. Perry, impressed by the boys' ingenuity and determination, considers purchasing the island group for future summer escapades, ensuring that the Catwhisker and its crew will have many more adventures to come.
