The narrative begins with Petr' Andréjïtch Grineff, the son of a retired senior major, who is sent to serve in a remote garrison at Fort Bélogorsk. Raised by his father's huntsman, Savéliitch, Petr' grows up with a traditional education. His father enrolls him in the military to instill discipline, but Petr' is more interested in the freedom and pleasures of life. His journey to the fort is marked by a snowstorm, during which he encounters a mysterious guide who helps him find shelter. This guide later turns out to be Emelian Pugatchéf, a fugitive and rebel leader.

Upon reaching Fort Bélogorsk, Petr' meets the simple and kind Commandant, Iván Kouzmitch, and his domineering wife, Vassilissa Igorofna. He also becomes acquainted with their daughter, Marya Ivánofna, and the officer Alexey Iványtch Chvabrine, who has been exiled there for killing a fellow officer in a duel. Petr' and Chvabrine initially become friends, but tensions rise when Petr' falls in love with Marya, whom Chvabrine has also proposed to but been rejected by. This results in a duel between Petr' and Chvabrine, during which Petr' is wounded.

As Petr' recovers, he and Marya confess their love for each other. However, Petr's father disapproves of the match, considering Marya's lack of dowry and status. Meanwhile, Pugatchéf, posing as the late Emperor Peter III, leads a Cossack rebellion against the Russian government, capturing several forts. The rebellion reaches Bélogorsk, where Pugatchéf executes the Commandant and his wife after they refuse to submit to him.

Petr', spared by Pugatchéf due to their previous encounter, is torn between his duty to the Tzarina and his love for Marya, who is now in danger under Chvabrine's control. Pugatchéf appoints Chvabrine as the new Commandant, leaving Marya vulnerable. Petr' decides to seek help from Orenburg to recapture the fort and protect Marya.

Throughout the story, Petr' struggles with his loyalty and honor, facing the moral dilemma of serving a usurper or staying true to his oath. His relationship with Pugatchéf, who shows him unexpected mercy, complicates his sense of duty. Ultimately, Petr' plans to leave for Orenburg to gather support against Pugatchéf and rescue Marya, demonstrating his commitment to both his country and his beloved.
