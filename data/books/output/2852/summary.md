In this narrative, Dr. John Watson recounts the mysterious events surrounding the Baskerville family, focusing on the death of Sir Charles Baskerville and the potential danger facing his heir, Sir Henry Baskerville. The story unfolds in the eerie setting of the Devonshire moor, where the legend of a supernatural hound haunts the Baskerville lineage. Dr. James Mortimer, a close friend and medical advisor to Sir Charles, seeks the help of Sherlock Holmes after Sir Charles is found dead under mysterious circumstances, with his face contorted in horror and the footprints of a massive hound nearby.

Holmes, intrigued by the case, sends Watson to accompany Sir Henry to Baskerville Hall and report back on any suspicious activities. Watson's investigation reveals a tapestry of local characters, each with potential motives and secrets. Among them are the Stapletons, a brother and sister living nearby, who are both enigmatic and involved in the unfolding drama. Watson observes a budding romance between Sir Henry and Miss Stapleton, which is met with hostility from her brother, Jack Stapleton.

Watson's letters to Holmes detail the strange occurrences at Baskerville Hall, including the nightly sobbing of a woman and the secretive behavior of the butler, Barrymore. Watson discovers that Barrymore is signaling someone on the moor, which leads to the revelation that Barrymore's wife is aiding her brother, Selden, an escaped convict hiding on the moor.

The plot thickens as Watson encounters various unsettling phenomena, including the eerie howls on the moor, which locals attribute to the legendary hound. Despite the supernatural undertones, Holmes remains skeptical and believes there is a rational explanation behind the events. Watson's observations also include a mysterious man on the moor, whom he suspects might be connected to the case.

Holmes eventually arrives in Devonshire, revealing he has been conducting his own covert investigation. He identifies Stapleton as a Baskerville by blood, who stands to inherit the estate should Sir Henry die. Holmes deduces that Stapleton has been using a ferocious hound, painted with phosphorus to appear spectral, to scare Sir Charles to death and now aims to eliminate Sir Henry.

The climax occurs when Holmes, Watson, and Inspector Lestrade set a trap for Stapleton. They witness the hound attacking Sir Henry but manage to kill the beast and save the baronet. Stapleton flees into the treacherous Grimpen Mire, where he presumably meets his end.

The narrative concludes with Holmes explaining the intricate details of Stapleton's plot, including his manipulation of Mrs. Laura Lyons, whom he deceived into luring Sir Charles to his death. Holmes's deductions and the resolution of the case restore peace to Baskerville Hall, with Sir Henry deciding to travel abroad to recover from his ordeal. The story is a testament to Holmes's unparalleled detective skills and Watson's unwavering loyalty and bravery.
