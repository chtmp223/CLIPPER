In Chapter 20, event 4, first-class scouts explore the cave and find only common items, but later, in event 5, they discover a hidden vault containing valuable items and a metal box. Therefore, the claim that the chamber was empty with no valuable items is misleading.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship between the discovery of the cave and the dangerous situation is valid and meaningful, as the rising water directly results from their exploration.
