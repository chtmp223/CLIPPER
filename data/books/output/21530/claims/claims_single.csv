    c. ""picking her up at a beach in Nice"": The outline states that Jean boards the Jungle Queen at the swimming cove of Cap Martin, not a beach in Nice. Stepney takes Lydia to Nice earlier, but this is unrelated to picking up Jean.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship between Stepney's decision to help Jean and the actions involving the Jungle Queen is not fully supported by the outline. The claim inaccurately describes the location and nature of the yacht's acquisition.
    b. The relationship is partially subjective, as it assumes theft and a specific location not supported by the outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the chapter outline, as it misrepresents key details about the yacht and the location.
