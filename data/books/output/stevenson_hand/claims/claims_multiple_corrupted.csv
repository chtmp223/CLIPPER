    a. ""Jim Godfrey plays a minimal role in the investigation"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline or book summary. The summary and chapter outlines indicate that Godfrey is actively involved in the investigation. He invites the narrator to the Bronx, witnesses the strange light, follows Swain into Vaughan's estate, and discusses the murder case with Lester.
    b. ""only appearing at the beginning to invite the narrator to stay at his place"": This part is contradicted by the chapter outline and summary. Godfrey is present in multiple chapters, including Chapter 1, Chapter 6, and Chapter 18, where he is actively involved in the investigation and discussions.
    c. ""then disappearing until the end of the case"": This part is also contradicted by the chapter outline and summary. Godfrey is consistently involved throughout the narrative, as seen in the chapter outlines where he participates in key events and discussions related to the case.
