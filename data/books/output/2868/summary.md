In a small, isolated village called Gartley, Professor Braddock, an eccentric Egyptologist, lives with his stepdaughter, Lucy Kendal, in a large, old Georgian house known as the Pyramids. Braddock is consumed by his passion for archaeology, particularly his interest in mummies and ancient Egyptian relics. Lucy manages the household with precision, allowing Braddock the freedom to indulge in his studies. She is romantically involved with Archie Hope, a struggling artist, but their engagement faces challenges due to financial constraints and the Professor's ambitions.

The story unfolds with the arrival of a significant artifact, the green mummy of Inca Caxas, which Braddock has purchased from Malta. Sidney Bolton, Braddock's assistant, is tasked with bringing the mummy back to England. However, upon its arrival at the Pyramids, the mummy is missing, and Bolton's strangled body is discovered in its place. This shocking event sets off a series of investigations into the murder and the disappearance of the mummy.

Captain Hervey, the skipper of the ship that transported the mummy, becomes a suspect due to his suspicious behavior and his knowledge of the mummy's value. He approaches Braddock, offering to help find the mummy for a fee, but Braddock is unable to pay. Hervey's involvement raises questions about his motives and potential knowledge of the crime.

Meanwhile, Sir Frank Random, a wealthy young baronet, returns to the nearby Fort after a yachting trip. He had previously proposed to Lucy, but she had refused him, choosing Archie instead. Despite this, Random remains a friend to both and becomes entangled in the mystery. He learns from Don Pedro de Gayangos, a Peruvian gentleman, that the mummy is of significant importance to him due to its historical and familial connections.

As the investigation progresses, it is revealed that multiple parties have an interest in the mummy. Don Pedro desires its return to Peru, believing it holds significant cultural value. Random, who develops feelings for Don Pedro's daughter, Inez, becomes involved in the search, hoping to clear his name after being indirectly implicated in the murder by Hervey.

The mystery deepens as various characters, including Widow Anne, Sidney's mother, and Mrs. Jasher, a widow with designs on Braddock, become involved. Mrs. Jasher is revealed to have written a blackmail letter to Random, claiming to have information about the murder. However, she denies any involvement in the crime itself.

The climax occurs when a confrontation on a river jetty leads to the discovery that Braddock and his Kanaka servant, Cockatoo, were involved in the crime. Cockatoo, under Braddock's orders, had murdered Bolton to steal the emeralds believed to be hidden within the mummy's wrappings. The mummy itself, used as a hiding place for Braddock during an attempted escape, reveals Braddock's body after being shot during the fracas.

In the aftermath, Cockatoo is arrested and eventually hanged for the murders, while Braddock's death brings an end to his archaeological ambitions. Lucy and Archie plan to marry and move away to start a new life, free from the shadow of the green mummy's curse. Random, having helped resolve the mystery, looks forward to a future with Inez, as Don Pedro prepares to return to Peru with the recovered emerald and the mummy of his ancestor.
