Eighteen years after the flight of Clare Lady Cranstoun and the birth of her daughter Stella, the story unfolds in the lush English countryside of Surrey, where the Braithwaite family is hosting two young men. The elder, Hilary Pritchard, is a handsome and athletic Yorkshireman, while his companion, Claud Viscount Carthew, is a plain but wealthy heir to the Earl of Northborough. The Braithwaite girls, eager for advantageous marriages, show interest in Lord Carthew due to his wealth and title, despite his lack of physical appeal.

As the friends depart, Lord Carthew expresses his disdain for the social climbing of the Braithwaite girls, revealing his desire to be loved for himself rather than his status. Hilary, in contrast, is humble and content with his simple life, planning to emigrate to Canada to farm land left to him by a relative.

The two embark on a journey through Kent, Surrey, and Hampshire, during which Lord Carthew proposes they switch identities to test the sycophancy of society toward titles. Hilary reluctantly agrees, and they proceed with their adventure, unaware that they are about to meet Stella Cranstoun, the daughter of Sir Philip Cranstoun, a stern and proud man with a deep-seated hatred for gypsies.

Stella, who has been raised in isolation under the strict supervision of her father, is a spirited and independent young woman, unaware of her true heritage as the daughter of Clare Carewe, a gypsy. Her father, Sir Philip, has concealed her origins, hoping to marry her off to a man of rank and wealth to erase the stain of her gypsy blood.

During a chance encounter in the woods, Hilary and Lord Carthew meet Stella, who is riding her horse with reckless abandon. Hilary, mistaking her horse's wild gallop for a runaway, intervenes, leading to a confrontation with a gamekeeper who accidentally shoots Hilary. Stella insists on taking him to the Chase for medical attention, where he falls for her beauty and spirit.

As Hilary recovers at the Chase, he and Stella grow closer, despite his initial belief that she is unattainable due to her social standing. Meanwhile, Lord Carthew, under the guise of Hilary Pritchard, finds himself charmed by Stella's innocence and natural grace, and he begins to fall in love with her.

Stella, unaware of the identity switch, is drawn to Hilary's rugged charm and straightforward nature, finding in him a kindred spirit who shares her disdain for the pretensions of high society. However, her father has other plans, having already arranged for her to marry Lord Carthew to secure the family's social standing.

As the day of the wedding approaches, Stella is torn between her duty to her family and her love for Hilary. She is further confused by a mysterious visit from her great-grandmother, Sarah Carewe, who reveals Stella's true heritage and offers the help of the gypsies to escape her impending marriage.

On the eve of the wedding, Stella is visited by Sarah, who gives her a token to signal the gypsies if she needs their help. Overwhelmed by the revelation of her origins and the pressure to marry a man she does not love, Stella decides to flee.

With the help of the gypsies, Stella escapes the Chase on her wedding day, leaving Lord Carthew to face the scandal of a bride who has vanished. Hilary, upon learning of Stella's disappearance, is determined to find her and prove his love.

As the story unfolds, the characters must confront their true selves and the societal expectations that bind them. Stella's journey to self-discovery and freedom challenges the rigid structures of class and tradition, ultimately leading to a resolution where love triumphs over social convention.
