   a. ""The small golden key Alice discovers in the long, low hall"": This part is grounded in event 4 of Chapter 1, where Alice finds a small golden key in the hall.
   b. ""is later used in combination with the mushroom to finally enter the beautiful garden"": This part is grounded in event 7 of Chapter 7, where Alice uses the golden key and the mushroom to enter the garden.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The claim describes a sequence of events where the key and the mushroom are used together to achieve a specific goal, which is entering the garden.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation or assumption; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.

   b. ""is later used in combination with the 'DRINK ME' bottle"": This part is partially grounded in the events. In event 5 of Chapter 1, Alice drinks from the ""DRINK ME"" bottle, which causes her to shrink. However, the outline does not explicitly state that the key is used in combination with the bottle to enter the garden.
   c. ""to finally enter the beautiful garden"": This part is not explicitly grounded in the chapter outline. While Alice does shrink to the right size after drinking from the bottle, the outline does not confirm that she uses the key to enter the garden at this point. In fact, event 7 of Chapter 1 indicates that Alice remains the same size after eating the cake, suggesting she does not enter the garden immediately.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the outline does not confirm that the key and the ""DRINK ME"" bottle are used together to enter the garden.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation, as the outline does not explicitly state this sequence of events.
   c. The relationship does not contradict the summary, but it is not supported by the chapter outline.
