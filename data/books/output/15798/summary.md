In a charming tale set in the late 19th century, we follow the lives of the Carr family, particularly focusing on Clover Carr and her brother Phil. The story begins with the Carr family preparing for Katy Carr's wedding to Lieutenant Ned Worthington, a naval officer. Katy, the eldest sister, is beloved by all, and her engagement to Ned is celebrated by the entire town of Burnet. The wedding is a simple, heartfelt affair, reflecting Katy's desire for a meaningful and intimate ceremony rather than a grand spectacle. After the wedding, Katy leaves with Ned, and the family adjusts to life without her presence.

Clover, now stepping into a more central role within the family, faces a new challenge when her brother Phil's health begins to decline. Phil, who has grown too quickly and is frail, suffers from a cold that develops into pneumonia. Concerned for his well-being, Dr. Carr decides that Phil must be sent to a healthier climate. After much consideration, Colorado is chosen for its reputedly beneficial air. Clover is tasked with accompanying Phil, a responsibility she embraces despite her initial trepidation.

Their journey to St. Helen's, Colorado, is facilitated by Katy and her friend Mrs. Ashe, who are traveling to California. Clover and Phil are joined by Mrs. Watson, a well-meaning but somewhat burdensome chaperone. Upon arrival in St. Helen's, they are greeted by Dr. Hope, an old friend of Dr. Carr. St. Helen's surprises Clover with its beauty and modernity, and she quickly makes friends, including the lively Marian Chase and the Wade family.

Clover and Phil's life in St. Helen's is enriched by the presence of their cousin Clarence Page, who lives nearby on a ranch. Clarence, along with his English partner Geoffrey Templestowe, invites Clover and Phil to visit their ranch, High Valley. The visit is a delightful escape, filled with horseback riding and the charm of the Colorado landscape. Clover finds herself enjoying the company of both Clarence and Geoff, though Clarence's attentions suggest he harbors deeper feelings for her.

Back in St. Helen's, Clover and Phil are invited to join a party traveling over the Marshall Pass in a private railroad car, a journey that offers breathtaking views and cements Clover's affection for the region. However, Phil's health takes a slight downturn, prompting Dr. Hope to recommend a stay in the Ute Valley, a more secluded and serene location.

Their time in the Ute Valley is peaceful and restorative, with frequent visits from Clarence and Geoff. As Phil recovers, Clover becomes more integrated into the community, enjoying the company of new friends and the natural beauty surrounding her. However, tensions arise when Clarence, misinterpreting Clover's affection, proposes to her. Clover, caught off guard, gently declines, valuing their cousinly bond but unable to reciprocate his romantic feelings.

The story beautifully captures the themes of family, friendship, and the challenges of growing up. Clover's journey from a supporting role in her family to a young woman capable of managing responsibilities and navigating complex emotions is depicted with warmth and humor. The Colorado setting, with its majestic landscapes and vibrant community, provides a rich backdrop for Clover's personal growth and the strengthening of family ties.
