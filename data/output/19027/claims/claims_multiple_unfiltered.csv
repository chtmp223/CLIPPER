    c. ""first with Solar Guard officials and later including the cadets"": The first meeting with Solar Guard officials is partially grounded in Chapter 2 (event 1), where Commander Walters meets with Captain Strong, Major Connel, Dr. Joan Dale, and Professor Sykes. The second meeting including the cadets is grounded in Chapter 8 (event 3), where the cadets attend a meeting with Commander Walters and others.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not meaningful because the claim incorrectly references Mars instead of Venus, which is the actual focus of the discussions.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline, particularly due to the incorrect mention of Mars.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the focus is on Venus, not Mars.

Since 1b. and 2a. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
