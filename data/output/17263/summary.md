In a quaint town called Troy, life is turned upside down with the arrival of the Honourable Frederic Augustus Hythe Goodwyn-Sandys and his wife, Geraldine. The town, known for its simplicity and old-world charm, is suddenly abuzz with curiosity and excitement over these new, aristocratic arrivals. Admiral Buzza, a prominent figure in Troy, mistakenly welcomes a mild-mannered stranger, Mr. Fogo, thinking him to be the Honourable Goodwyn-Sandys. This mistake becomes a source of amusement for the entire town.

Mr. Fogo, seeking solitude, decides to rent the mysterious Kit's House, rumored to be haunted by the spirits of lepers who once lived there. He hires Caleb Trotter, a humorous and talkative local, as his servant. Despite his desire for solitude, Mr. Fogo becomes entangled in the lives of the townspeople, particularly the Dearlove family, who own Kit's House. The Dearloves, consisting of twins Peter and Paul and their sister Tamsin, are simple, kind-hearted folk who welcome Mr. Fogo into their world.

Meanwhile, the Goodwyn-Sandys charm the townspeople, especially the women, with their sophistication and apparent high status. Mrs. Goodwyn-Sandys, in particular, captivates the men with her beauty and flirtatious nature, leading to tensions and rivalries among the local bachelors, including Sam Buzza and Mr. Moggridge, the town poet.

As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the Goodwyn-Sandys are not who they seem. They are involved in a dynamite plot, using the guise of socialites to mask their true intentions. Their sudden disappearance leaves the town in shock and chaos, as tradesmen and locals scramble to reclaim their goods from "The Bower," the couple's rented home.

Amidst the turmoil, Mr. Fogo's life takes a turn when he falls ill and is nursed back to health by Tamsin. During his recovery, he realizes his feelings for her, and the two eventually become engaged, much to the delight of her protective brothers.

The novel concludes with the wedding of Mr. Fogo and Tamsin, marking a new chapter in their lives. The townspeople of Troy, despite the upheavals, return to their routines, but with a lingering sense that their innocence has been touched by the events surrounding the Goodwyn-Sandys.

The story of Troy is one of humor, romance, and the clash between simplicity and sophistication, set against the backdrop of a town that cherishes its traditions but is not immune to change.
