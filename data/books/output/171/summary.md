Mr. Temple, the youngest son of a noble family, resolves to marry for love rather than wealth, unlike his siblings who have sacrificed happiness for financial security. With a modest estate, he dedicates himself to helping the unfortunate. One day, he is taken by a young officer, Blakeney, to visit Captain Eldridge, a destitute man in prison, supported only by his daughter, Miss Eldridge. Temple is moved by their plight and vows to help.

Meanwhile, Charlotte Temple, a young girl at a boarding school, meets Montraville, a soldier, and they fall in love. Despite her initial resistance due to her sense of duty to her family, she is persuaded by Montraville and her friend, Mademoiselle La Rue, to elope with him to America. Montraville promises marriage, but Charlotte is torn between love and duty, fearing the pain her actions will cause her family.

As Charlotte struggles with her decision, her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Temple, plan a surprise for her birthday, unaware of her turmoil. Mr. Eldridge, Charlotte's grandfather, is sent to bring her home but discovers she has eloped. The family is devastated, and Mr. Eldridge blames himself for not protecting his granddaughter.

In America, Charlotte is abandoned by Montraville, who is influenced by Belcour, a deceitful friend. Charlotte's situation worsens as she becomes pregnant and is left without support. She writes a desperate letter to her parents, hoping for forgiveness and aid.

Mrs. Beauchamp, a kind woman, discovers Charlotte's plight and offers her friendship and support. However, Charlotte's health deteriorates, and she gives birth in poverty. Montraville, feeling remorse, tries to provide for her but is misled by Belcour, who withholds the money meant for Charlotte.

Charlotte's parents, upon receiving her letter, are heartbroken but resolve to forgive her and bring her home. Mr. Temple travels to America, but Charlotte dies before he arrives. Montraville, stricken with guilt, confronts Belcour and kills him in a duel, but is left with lasting remorse.

The story concludes with Charlotte's family mourning her loss but finding solace in caring for her child. Mrs. Crayton, formerly La Rue, meets a miserable end, highlighting the consequences of her actions. The narrative serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of passion and the importance of virtue and forgiveness.
