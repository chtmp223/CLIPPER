In Chapter 1, Hanlon is informed that joining the Secret Service requires a public dismissal in disgrace. Chapter 4 details the staged event of Hanlon being accused of cheating and subsequently dismissed by Admiral Rogers, fulfilling this requirement. This connection reveals that the confrontation and dismissal were orchestrated to establish Hanlon's cover for his Secret Service role.","The corrupted fact presents the cheating accusation and dismissal as genuine events, rather than a staged occurrence. It also incorrectly suggests that Hanlon's recruitment into the Secret Service was a result of these events, rather than a pre-planned arrangement.","Chapter 1, 4","- Chapter 4, item 2: An instructor accuses Hanlon of cheating during the exam, leading to a heated confrontation in the classroom.
