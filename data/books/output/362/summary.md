Billy Neilson, a spirited and independent young woman, is at the center of a lively social circle in Boston, where she navigates relationships, friendships, and personal growth. The narrative unfolds with Billy's engagement to Bertram Henshaw, a talented artist known for his portraits of women. Their relationship is tested by the challenges of balancing personal ambitions with romantic commitments, as well as by the interference of well-meaning but meddlesome friends and family.

Billy's life is further complicated by the arrival of M. J. Arkwright, a charming tenor with whom she shares a deep musical connection. Arkwright, initially mistaken for a woman due to a nickname, becomes a close friend and confidant, though his presence stirs jealousy in Bertram. Billy's engagement to Bertram is strained by her fear that he loves only the "tilt of her chin" rather than her true self, a fear exacerbated by the opinions of others who doubt Bertram's capacity for serious love.

As Billy wrestles with these doubts, she is also involved in organizing an operetta for charity, which brings her into contact with Alice Greggory, a proud young woman from a once-wealthy family now fallen on hard times. Billy's efforts to help the Greggorys are complicated by Alice's pride and the lingering effects of a past misunderstanding with Arkwright.

The story is rich with themes of love, loyalty, and the pursuit of artistic and personal fulfillment. Billy's journey is one of self-discovery as she learns to trust her instincts and the love she shares with Bertram. Her relationship with Bertram ultimately deepens as they confront their fears and insecurities, leading to a reaffirmation of their commitment to each other.

Supporting characters, including Billy's Aunt Hannah, the Henshaw brothers, and a host of friends, add depth and humor to the narrative, each bringing their own perspectives on love and life. The novel explores the complexities of human relationships with warmth and wit, capturing the essence of a vibrant social milieu and the timeless struggles of balancing love and ambition.
