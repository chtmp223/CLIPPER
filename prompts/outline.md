Your task is to create a detailed and objective outline for Chapter {order} of a book. You will be provided with the text of Chapter {order}. Ensure that your outline faithfully represents the content of the text.

First, carefully read the text of Chapter {order}:
<current_chapter>
{curr}
<current_chapter>

Finally, create an outline for Chapter {order} using the following format:

<synopsis>A one-sentence summary of the current chapter.</synopsis>
<events>A chronological list of at most 7 major events in the chapter. The list should formatted as a numbered list. Each event should be one sentence long, describing specific details on what happens, where it happens, and which characters are involved. DO NOT include subjective interpretation of the events.</events>
<characters>A numbered list of characters in the chapter. Include only those that are mentioned in the major events. Each character should have the format: [character full name]: [character role/relationship with the main characters], [physical appearance (if mentioned)], [personality (if mentioned)], first seen at [the first setting the character is in], last seen at [last setting the character is in].</characters>

Now, create an objective outline for Chapter {order} based on the provided text. Ensure that your outline is concise, coherent, and accurately represents the content of the chapter.

<synopsis>
[One-sentence summary of the current chapter.]
</synopsis>
<events>
1. [Event 1: Specific details on specific details on what happens, where it happens, and which characters are involved.]
2. [Event 2: Specific details on what happens, where it happens, and which characters are involved.]
3. [Event 3: Specific details on what happens, where it happens, and which characters are involved.]
4. [Event 4: Specific details on what happens, where it happens, and which characters are involved.]
5. [Event 5: Specific details on what happens, where it happens, and which characters are involved.]
6. [Event 6: Specific details on what happens, where it happens, and which characters are involved.]
7. [Event 7: Specific details on what happens, where it happens, and which characters are involved.]
</events>
<characters>
1. [Character 1: Character role/relationship with the main characters, physical appearance (if mentioned), personality (if mentioned), first seen at the first setting the character is in, last seen at the last setting the character is in.]
(Repeat the format for each character mentioned in the major events.)
</characters>

Remember to focus on the objective representation of the chapter content and avoid adding personal opinions or interpretations. Good luck!
