The story unfolds in the aftermath of a devastating Martian invasion of Earth, which left cities in ruins and humanity in despair. The Martians, possessing advanced technology and a mysterious explosive, nearly annihilated Earth, but were ultimately defeated by terrestrial diseases. As the survivors of Earth begin to rebuild, astronomers observe ominous signs suggesting the Martians are preparing for another assault. Amidst this backdrop of fear and uncertainty, a glimmer of hope emerges from the laboratory of Thomas Edison, who has discovered a way to harness powerful energies to counter the Martian threat.

Edison, along with other scientific luminaries like Lord Kelvin and Herr Roentgen, devises a plan to use these newfound energies to build a fleet of electrical ships equipped with disintegratorsâ€”devices capable of reducing any matter to its atomic components. The world unites in support of this endeavor, pooling resources and expertise to prepare for an offensive against Mars. This global effort culminates in a grand congress of nations in Washington, where leaders and scientists gather to strategize and allocate a massive war fund for the construction of the fleet.

As the fleet is assembled, Edison and his team conduct a test flight to the moon, during which they confirm the existence of ancient lunar civilizations through the discovery of ruins and artifacts. This revelation adds to the urgency and determination of the expedition. The fleet, now fully equipped and manned by the brightest minds from various fields, sets out for Mars, driven by the dual objectives of defense and exploration.

During the journey, the fleet encounters several challenges, including a collision with a meteor and a near-miss with a comet, which demonstrates the precariousness of space travel. Despite these setbacks, the expedition presses on, driven by the necessity of preventing another Martian invasion. As they approach Mars, they capture a Martian prisoner, who becomes instrumental in teaching them about Martian language and culture, providing invaluable insight into the enemy they face.

Upon reaching Mars, the fleet observes the planet's surface, noting its complex network of canals and the presence of fortified cities. The Martians are technologically advanced and prepared for defense, but Edison's fleet possesses the element of surprise and superior maneuverability. The story climaxes as the fleet engages the Martians in a series of strategic battles, utilizing their disintegrators to devastating effect.

The narrative explores themes of unity, resilience, and the power of human ingenuity in the face of existential threats. It presents a vision of a world where scientific progress and international cooperation are the keys to overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges. As the story concludes, the expedition's success is celebrated as a triumph of human spirit and intellect, ensuring the safety and future of Earth against the Martian menace.
