    a. ""First Officer Conway Costigan saves Clio Marsden from a Vee-Two gas attack"": This part is grounded in the book summary, which describes Costigan saving Clio from a gas attack by donning space suits and reaching an airlock. It is also supported by event 3 in the Chapter 1 outline, where Costigan saves Clio from the gas attack.

   a. Costigan and Bradley were repairing the stolen Nevian lifeboat on Nevia's ocean surface: This part is grounded in event 1 of Chapter 6, where Costigan and Bradley are indeed repairing the lifeboat on the ocean surface of Nevia.
   b. A Nevian submarine attacked and dragged the vessel underwater: This part is partially grounded in event 3 of Chapter 6, where a submarine crewed by fish-like beings attacks the lifeboat. However, the outline does not specify that the submarine dragged the vessel underwater; instead, it mentions a battle as Costigan tries to escape.

   a. The relationship is not entirely valid because the claim suggests a direct sequence of events (repairing followed by being dragged underwater), but the outline does not explicitly state that the lifeboat was dragged underwater by the submarine. The outline only mentions an attack and a battle.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation, as the claim assumes the submarine dragged the lifeboat underwater, which is not explicitly stated in the outline.

"The Boise's destruction of a Nevian city using Adlington's ""Special"" bomb prompts Nerado to call for a ceasefire and propose peace negotiations with the Triplanetary representatives.",The Boise's destruction of a Nevian city using conventional weapons prompts Nerado to escalate the conflict and launch a counterattack against Earth.,"This fact establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship between two events in Chapter 13. The Boise's action of destroying a Nevian city with a powerful weapon (Adlington's ""Special"" bomb) leads directly to Nerado's decision to call for a ceasefire and initiate peace negotiations. This demonstrates how the use of overwhelming force by the Boise influences the Nevians' strategic decisions.","This corrupted fact changes multiple elements of the original events. It replaces Adlington's ""Special"" bomb with conventional weapons and alters Nerado's response from seeking peace to escalating the conflict, which contradicts the sequence of events in the original outline.","Chapter 13 (Items 5, 6)","- Chapter 13, item 5: Upon reaching Nevia, the Boise destroys a Nevian city using Adlington's ""Special"" bomb.

    a. ""The Boise's destruction of a Nevian city using Adlington's 'Special' bomb"": This part is grounded in event 5 of Chapter 13, where the Boise destroys a Nevian city using Adlington's ""Special"" bomb.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The destruction of the Nevian city by the Boise using Adlington's ""Special"" bomb is a significant event that logically leads to Nerado calling for a ceasefire and proposing peace negotiations. This cause-and-effect relationship is explicitly outlined in the chapter.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is directly supported by the sequence of events in the chapter outline.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline. There is no contradicting information in the summary, and the sequence of events in the chapter outline supports the claim.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""The Boise's destruction of a Nevian city using conventional weapons"": This part is partially grounded in event 5 of Chapter 13, where the Boise destroys a Nevian city. However, the outline specifies the use of Adlington's ""Special"" bomb, which suggests a specific, possibly unconventional weapon, rather than conventional weapons.
   b. ""prompts Nerado to escalate the conflict and launch a counterattack against Earth"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. Instead, event 6 indicates that Nerado calls for a ceasefire and proposes peace negotiations, which contradicts the claim of escalation and counterattack.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid. The destruction of the Nevian city leads to a call for peace negotiations, not an escalation or counterattack.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the events lead to peace negotiations rather than further conflict.

It shows the progression from Nerado's initial call for a ceasefire and peace negotiations to the actual signing of a peace treaty. The fact also specifies that the treaty was signed aboard the Boise and outlines its key provisions: the establishment of trade and knowledge exchange between the two parties. This demonstrates the successful conclusion of the diplomatic process initiated by Nerado.,"This corrupted fact misrepresents the outcome of the peace negotiations. Instead of a mutually beneficial treaty establishing trade and knowledge exchange, it incorrectly states that the Nevians surrendered unconditionally, which is not consistent with the events described in the original outline.","Chapter 13 (Items 6, 7)","- Chapter 13, item 6: Nerado calls for a ceasefire and proposes peace negotiations with the Triplanetary representatives.
