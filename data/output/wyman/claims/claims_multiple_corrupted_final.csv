- Relationship: Continuation of events",Unique,Valid claim,INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""After finding and carrying the unconscious captain from a stateroom to the deck of the sinking ship"": This part is grounded in events 6 and 7 of Chapter 1, where Bob and Jack find the unconscious captain in a stateroom and carry him to the deck.
   b. ""Bob and Jack rescue him and escape in a lifeboat"": This part is not directly grounded in the chapter outline. In Chapter 1, the last lifeboat departs without them, leaving them stranded on the sinking ship. However, the book summary mentions that they eventually manage to escape in a lifeboat, but this is not detailed in the chapter outline.

   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation but lacks explicit grounding in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship does not contradict the book summary, which mentions their eventual escape, but it is not supported by the chapter outline's sequence of events.
