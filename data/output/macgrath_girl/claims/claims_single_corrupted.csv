2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid because the chapter outline clearly states that only Gretchen has the burn scar, not both women. Therefore, the claim that both women bear the mark is incorrect.

   c. The relationship contradicts the information in the chapter outline, which clearly identifies Gretchen as the one with the burn scar.

Since the claim contains a factual inaccuracy regarding the presence of the burn scar on both women, it is not consistent with the chapter outline."
