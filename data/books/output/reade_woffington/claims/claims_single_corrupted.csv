Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""After the household carries Mabel to bed"": This part is grounded in event 6 of Chapter 12, where the household carries Mabel to bed.
    b. ""Mr. Vane, feeling relieved and calm, decides to wait until morning to call for a doctor"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. Instead, event 7 states that Mr. Vane, overcome with remorse and fear, rushes to find a doctor, which directly contradicts the claim that he feels relieved and calm and decides to wait.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not valid because the claim contradicts the chapter outline. Mr. Vane's actions are driven by remorse and fear, not relief and calmness, and he does not wait until morning to call for a doctor.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation but rather a misrepresentation of the events described in the chapter outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it contradicts the outlined events.

Since the claim contradicts the chapter outline and misrepresents Mr. Vane's actions and emotional state, it is INVALID."
