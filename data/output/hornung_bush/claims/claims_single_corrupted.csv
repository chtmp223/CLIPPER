    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. Alfred's invitation to his mother and the suggestion about her winter plans are directly connected and presented as part of the same event in the chapter outline.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.

    a. ""Alfred invites his mother to permanently relocate to Australia"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline.

    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as there is no mention of a permanent move or selling the estate.
