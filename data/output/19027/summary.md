In the year A.D. 2353, aboard the rocket cruiser Polaris, Space Cadets Tom Corbett, Roger Manning, and Astro, along with their examining officer Captain Steve Strong, are engaged in the final test for unit honors at Space Academy. The crucial task involves Tom navigating back to the ship blindfolded, guided only by audio instructions. Successfully completing the test, the Polaris unit wins the term honors, much to the joy of its members. As they prepare to return to the Academy, plans are made for a hunting trip to Venus during their leave.

Upon arrival at Venus, the cadets are drawn into a complex situation involving a secret organization called the Venusian Nationalists. Major Lou Connel of the Solar Guard is sent to investigate the organization, suspected of harboring separatist intentions against the Solar Alliance. The cadets, initially on a hunting expedition for the dangerous tyrannosaurus, find themselves embroiled in the investigation after a series of unexpected events, including a bomb planted on the Polaris and an encounter with the Nationalists.

The Nationalists, led by a man named Lactu, are revealed to be a well-organized group with a hidden base, aiming to make Venus independent from the Solar Alliance. They have recruited many unsuspecting Venusians, who are forced into labor under harsh conditions. The cadets and Major Connel conduct a dangerous mission through the Venusian jungle to uncover the Nationalists' base, facing both the perils of the jungle and the threat of the Nationalists' patrols.

Astro, familiar with the jungle from his youth, plays a key role in navigating the treacherous terrain. The cadets witness the brutal realities of the Nationalists' operations, including the use of slaves to build their facilities. Despite the challenges, they manage to gather crucial information about the organization and its plans.

Meanwhile, the Solar Guard, led by Commander Walters and Captain Strong, prepares for a coordinated attack on the Nationalists' base. The cadets, through their bravery and quick thinking, help to dismantle the Nationalists' operations. Connel and the cadets engage in a final battle against the Nationalists, successfully thwarting their plans and ensuring the safety of the Solar Alliance.

The adventure concludes with the cadets returning to Space Academy, having played a significant role in preserving peace in the solar system. Their experiences highlight the dangers of separatist movements and the importance of unity within the Solar Alliance. As they reflect on their mission, the cadets prepare to resume their studies, ready for future challenges as members of the Solar Guard.
