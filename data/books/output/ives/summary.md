Betsy, a young girl from a small New Hampshire farm, finds herself thrust into a new life after her father abandons the family, and her mother succumbs to illness. With no one left to care for her, Betsy receives an invitation from a distant relative, Aunt Kate Johns, to come and stay with her for a year. Overwhelmed by the rapid changes and still grieving her mother's death, Betsy embarks on her first railway journey to Aunt Kate's home, Hill-Top, a grand estate near a large hospital where her Uncle Ben is the superintendent.

Upon her arrival, Betsy is awed by the magnificence of her new surroundings, which are a far cry from the humble red house she left behind. Aunt Kate, a vision of elegance and kindness, welcomes Betsy into her home, offering her not just shelter but a chance at a new life. Despite her initial fear and shyness, Betsy begins to adapt to her new environment, learning to navigate the complexities of her new family and home.

Betsy’s new life is further enriched by the arrival of Vanart VI, a lively and charming fox-terrier puppy gifted to her by Uncle Bob. Van, as he is affectionately called, quickly becomes Betsy's constant companion and helps her to open up emotionally. Together, they explore the vast grounds of Hill-Top, forming a bond that brings out the best in both of them.

Aunt Kate takes it upon herself to teach Betsy manners and proper etiquette, starting with her appearance and table manners. She introduces Betsy to the idea that self-respect is closely tied to how one presents oneself to the world. Betsy, eager to please and learn, quickly absorbs these lessons, noting them in a special book of "Manners" that Aunt Kate gives her. Betsy’s transformation is gradual but significant, as she begins to embody the grace and dignity that Aunt Kate hopes to instill in her.

Meanwhile, Van proves to be more than just a playful pet. His natural instincts as a rat-catcher make him a valuable asset to the hospital, where he is enlisted to help rid the grounds of pests. Van's adventures, including his spirited participation in a Fourth of July parade and his unexpected visit to Betsy's Sunday School, bring joy and laughter to the household, even as they occasionally lead to chaos.

As the months pass, Betsy becomes more integrated into her new life. She starts attending a nearby school, where she is determined to learn everything she can, despite initial feelings of being different from her classmates. Her academic success and growing confidence help her to slowly overcome her shyness and form connections with other children.

Throughout all these changes, Betsy remains haunted by the fear that her father might return to claim her. However, Uncle Ben reassures her that they will fight to keep her safe. The family’s love and support, combined with Betsy’s own resilience and determination, help her to gradually heal from the traumas of her past.

By the end of the story, Betsy has not only found a new home but also a new identity as part of the Johns family. Her journey from a frightened, neglected child to a confident and beloved daughter is mirrored by Van’s own growth from a mischievous puppy to a brave and loyal companion. Together, they navigate the challenges and joys of their new life, embodying the themes of love, family, and the transformative power of kindness and acceptance.
