In the narrative, we are introduced to a complex and intriguing mystery surrounding the attempted murder of Mademoiselle Stangerson at the Château du Glandier. Joseph Rouletabille, a young and brilliant reporter, is determined to solve the case, which has baffled the police and the famous detective Frédéric Larsan. The crime took place in a locked room known as "The Yellow Room," where Mademoiselle Stangerson was found severely injured. The room was securely locked from the inside, and there was no apparent way for the assailant to have escaped, leading to a seemingly impossible crime.

The story unfolds as Rouletabille, along with his friend and narrator, Sinclair, investigates the mysterious events. They arrive at the château and begin their inquiry by examining the crime scene and questioning the people involved, including Mademoiselle Stangerson's fiancé, Monsieur Robert Darzac, who becomes a prime suspect due to circumstantial evidence.

Rouletabille's investigation is marked by his unique method of reasoning, which involves piecing together seemingly unrelated clues and observing minute details that others overlook. He discovers that the murderer left a bloody handprint on the wall, which becomes a crucial piece of evidence. Despite the apparent evidence against Darzac, Rouletabille is convinced of his innocence and works tirelessly to uncover the truth.

As the investigation progresses, Rouletabille uncovers a web of secrets involving Mademoiselle Stangerson's past. It is revealed that she had a previous relationship with a man named Jean Roussel, who is actually a notorious criminal known as Ballmeyer. Ballmeyer, under the guise of Frédéric Larsan, has been manipulating events to frame Darzac for the crime.

Rouletabille's journey takes him to America, where he gathers critical information about Ballmeyer's true identity and his connection to Mademoiselle Stangerson. Armed with this knowledge, Rouletabille returns to France and presents his findings in court, exonerating Darzac and exposing Ballmeyer as the true culprit.

The narrative is a thrilling exploration of a seemingly unsolvable mystery, showcasing Rouletabille's deductive prowess and the intricate layers of deception surrounding the crime. Ultimately, Rouletabille's relentless pursuit of the truth and his ability to see beyond the obvious lead to the resolution of the case, revealing the depths of human complexity and the power of reason.
