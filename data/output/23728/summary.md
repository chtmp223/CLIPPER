Walter King, affectionately nicknamed "His Highness" by the residents of Lovell's Harbor, is a lively fifteen-year-old boy with a passion for the sea and a penchant for getting into scrapes. Despite his youthful exuberance and occasional forgetfulness, Walter is hardworking and determined to help his widowed mother, Mrs. King, with their financial burdens. The story unfolds in the picturesque seaside village of Lovell's Harbor, where Walter spends his days fishing and tending to various chores, much to the chagrin of his mother, who wishes he would take more care with his appearance.

The plot thickens when Walter is offered a summer job by Jerry Thomas, the caretaker of Surfside, the lavish summer estate of the wealthy Crowninshield family. Walter is to look after their prized pack of dogs, including a valuable Pekingese named Lola. Although Walter's mother is initially hesitant, concerned about the responsibility of caring for such expensive animals, she eventually agrees, seeing it as a way to ease their financial struggles.

As Walter settles into his new role, he quickly becomes acquainted with the Crowninshield family: Mr. Glenmore Archibald Crowninshield, a New York banker; his wife, Mrs. Crowninshield; their athletic daughter, Nancy; and their mechanically inclined son, Richard, who is close in age to Walter. Walter's cheerful demeanor and willingness to help soon endear him to the staff and the family, despite the challenges of managing the dogs, particularly the aloof Airedales and the delicate Pekingese.

The tranquility of Walter's summer is shattered when Lola mysteriously disappears, leading to suspicions of theft. Mr. Crowninshield, who is fiercely protective of his possessions, is determined to recover Lola and enlists the help of New York detectives. The investigation reveals that the theft was orchestrated by a rival, Jake Daly, who had previously expressed interest in acquiring Lola.

Walter's brother, Bob King, a skilled wireless operator stationed at Seaver Bay, becomes instrumental in the search for Lola. Using his expertise, Bob communicates with other stations and intercepts a crucial message that helps track the thief's movements. Meanwhile, Walter and Bob's efforts are further complicated by the need to keep the investigation discreet to avoid alerting the thieves.

As the detectives close in on the culprits, Walter and Bob's resourcefulness and bravery are put to the test. The narrative builds to a climax as the Crowninshields and the detectives devise a plan to recover Lola, involving a clever ruse by Bob's colleague, O'Connel, who infiltrates the thieves' circle on the yacht Siren, where Lola is being held.

In a thrilling resolution, O'Connel manages to rescue Lola and return her safely to the Crowninshields, much to the family's relief and gratitude. The story concludes with Mr. Crowninshield expressing his appreciation for Walter and Bob's efforts, offering to support their future endeavors and ensure Mrs. King's financial security.

Throughout the novel, themes of loyalty, responsibility, and the transition from youth to adulthood are explored against the backdrop of a vibrant coastal community. Walter's journey from a carefree boy to a responsible young man is marked by his growing understanding of the importance of family, friendship, and integrity.
