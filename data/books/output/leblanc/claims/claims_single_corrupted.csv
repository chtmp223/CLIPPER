   b. ""Mme. de la Vaudraye opens it"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. Instead, the outline states that Mme. de la Vaudraye tears up the letter, as indicated in event 7.
   c. ""Gilberte discovers her true identity"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The outline does not mention Gilberte discovering her true identity; rather, it suggests that the contents of the letter remain unknown because it is torn up.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid because the sequence of events described in the claim does not occur in the chapter outline.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship contradicts the information in the chapter outline, where the letter is not read, and Gilberte's true identity is not revealed.

Since none of the atomic parts are grounded in the chapter outline, and the relationship between them is not valid, the claim is INVALID."

   a. ""Shortly after Adèle informs Gilberte of rumors about Guillaume's engagement to Mlle. Charmeron, which Gilberte dismisses"": This part is grounded in event 2 of Chapter 11, where Adèle informs Gilberte of the rumors, and Gilberte dismisses them.
   b. ""Guillaume visits Gilberte's home with his mother, Mme. de la Vaudraye"": This part is grounded in event 3 of Chapter 11, where Guillaume visits Gilberte at her home, accompanied by his mother.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is temporal and sequential, as the visit by Guillaume and his mother follows the rumors being dismissed by Gilberte. The use of ""shortly after"" suggests a close temporal proximity, which is consistent with the sequence of events in the chapter outline.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is based on the sequence of events as outlined in the chapter.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the chapter outline and does not contradict any information in the book summary.

   a. ""Shortly after Adèle informs Gilberte of rumors about Guillaume's engagement to Mlle. Charmeron"": This part is partially grounded in event 2 of Chapter 11, where Adèle informs Gilberte of the rumors. However, the claim incorrectly states that Gilberte believes the rumors, while the outline indicates that Gilberte dismisses them.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid because the claim misrepresents the events. Gilberte does not believe the rumors, and Guillaume does not visit alone to explain the misunderstanding.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it contradicts the details provided.

Since the claim contains inaccuracies in both atomic parts and the relationship between them is not valid, the claim is INVALID."
