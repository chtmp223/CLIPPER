In the bustling city of London, Mr. Gabriel John Utterson, a reserved and thoughtful lawyer, is introduced as a man of strict habits and deep loyalty to his friends. His closest companion is Mr. Richard Enfield, a distant cousin and a well-known man about town. Despite their differing personalities, the two share a weekly Sunday walk, which leads them down a peculiar street where they encounter a sinister-looking building with a mysterious door. This door becomes the focal point of a disturbing tale recounted by Enfield, involving a man named Mr. Edward Hyde.

Enfield describes a chilling incident where he witnessed Hyde, a small and menacing figure, brutally trample a young girl. The ensuing uproar led to Hyde compensating the girl's family with a cheque signed by a reputable and well-known figure, whose name Enfield refrains from disclosing. Utterson, intrigued and disturbed by the story, learns that the door is associated with the residence of his friend, Dr. Henry Jekyll, a respected scientist and philanthropist.

Utterson's concern deepens when he recalls Jekyll's peculiar will, which stipulates that in the event of his death or disappearance, all his possessions should be passed to Hyde. Utterson suspects foul play and resolves to uncover the truth about Hyde's relationship with Jekyll. His investigation leads him to Dr. Hastie Lanyon, an old friend of both Utterson and Jekyll, who reveals that he has fallen out with Jekyll over scientific disagreements but knows nothing of Hyde.

As Utterson's obsession with Hyde grows, he stakes out the mysterious door and eventually encounters Hyde himself. The meeting leaves Utterson with a sense of profound unease, as Hyde's appearance is unsettling and indefinable. Despite Hyde's hostility, Utterson is determined to protect Jekyll from this malevolent influence.

The narrative shifts to Dr. Jekyll, who provides a detailed confession of his experiments with a transformative potion. Jekyll reveals his lifelong struggle with the duality of human nature, which led him to create a potion that separates his good and evil sides. This experiment results in the birth of Edward Hyde, a being devoid of conscience and wholly evil. Initially, Jekyll revels in the freedom Hyde provides, indulging in vices without tarnishing his own reputation. However, as Hyde's actions grow increasingly violent, Jekyll struggles to control his dark alter ego.

The situation escalates when Hyde commits a heinous murder, forcing Jekyll to renounce his transformations. Despite his resolve, Jekyll finds himself involuntarily transforming into Hyde, losing control over the change. Desperate and fearing for his life, Jekyll isolates himself, relying on a dwindling supply of the potion to maintain his identity.

The story reaches a climax when Utterson and Poole, Jekyll's butler, break into the laboratory after hearing disturbing sounds. They discover Hyde's lifeless body, dressed in Jekyll's clothes, and a letter from Jekyll explaining his tragic downfall. Jekyll's narrative reveals that his original supply of the potion's key ingredient was impure, and he is unable to replicate it, sealing his fate as Hyde permanently.

The novel concludes with Dr. Lanyon's account of witnessing Hyde's transformation back into Jekyll, an experience that shatters Lanyon's sanity and ultimately leads to his death. Jekyll's final confession details his remorse and recognition of the irreversible consequences of his experiments. As Hyde's persona permanently takes over, Jekyll's life ends, leaving Utterson and the reader to grapple with the profound moral implications of the duality of human nature.
