Cadet George Hanlon, a young man with a hidden talent for mind-reading, finds himself unexpectedly summoned by Admiral Rogers, the Commandant of Cadets. Initially fearing punishment, Hanlon is surprised to learn that the Corps knows of his unique ability and his troubled past, including his father's disgrace and his own suppressed psychic powers. Rogers reveals that Hanlon is being considered for a special assignment with the Secret Service of the Inter-Stellar Corps, a top-secret organization tasked with maintaining peace and security across the galaxy. Despite his initial reluctance, Hanlon agrees to join, understanding that he must endure public disgrace as part of his cover.

Hanlon's first task is to investigate a mysterious situation on Simonides Four, a planet within the Federation where a suspected plot threatens interstellar peace. He is to use his mind-reading abilities to gather information, as previous agents have failed to penetrate the secrecy surrounding the situation. Before leaving, Hanlon undergoes a staged dismissal from the Corps, a painful experience as he is publicly accused of cheating and expelled in disgrace.

Traveling to Simonides aboard the luxury liner "Hellene," Hanlon begins practicing his mind-reading skills on fellow passengers. He discovers he can not only read surface thoughts but also control animals, a revelation that excites and terrifies him. Onboard, he encounters a man named Panek, whose sinister thoughts reveal a plot to kill a fellow passenger, Hector Abrams, a Simonidean diplomat. Hanlon intervenes, saving Abrams while making it appear as though he is aiding Panek, thus gaining the thug's trust and an invitation to meet his associates on Simonides.

Hanlon's journey to Simonides is fraught with tension as he navigates his new abilities and the dangerous underworld he must infiltrate. He realizes the enormity of his task, balancing the need to gather intelligence with the constant threat of exposure. His mission is complicated by the presence of powerful adversaries and the need to uncover the true nature of the plot against the Federation.

Upon arrival on Simonides, Hanlon must continue his undercover work, seeking to penetrate the conspiracy and report back to the Corps. His ability to read and control minds becomes crucial as he delves deeper into the web of intrigue, facing challenges that test his courage, loyalty, and newfound powers. Throughout, Hanlon is driven by a deep sense of duty and a desire to prove himself worthy of the trust placed in him by the Secret Service and his father, who he has recently reconciled with after years of misunderstanding and resentment.
