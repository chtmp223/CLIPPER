The story revolves around a group of siblings, led by Oswald Bastable, who are determined to restore the fallen fortunes of their family. The narrative is set in Victorian England and follows the children's various imaginative and adventurous attempts to find treasure or earn money. The siblings include Oswald, the narrator, his brother Dicky, sisters Dora and Alice, and their younger brothers Noel and H. O. They live in a house on Lewisham Road near Blackheath, which provides the backdrop for many of their escapades.

The children embark on numerous schemes, inspired by the adventure stories they read. They attempt treasure hunting by digging in their garden, based on the idea that buried treasure could be hidden there. Their efforts, however, yield only a half-sovereign, which they find under the floorboards, leading to a small but temporary windfall.

In another venture, they try their hand at journalism, creating a newspaper called "The Lewisham Recorder." Each sibling contributes stories, poems, and articles, but the endeavor does not prove financially rewarding. Their attempts to sell the paper to friends and neighbors result in minimal success, highlighting the challenges of running a business.

The siblings also explore the idea of becoming bandits, inspired by tales of highwaymen and robbers. They playfully capture Albert-next-door, an orphaned boy who sometimes joins their games, and hold him for ransom. This plan, too, is more playful than profitable, and they eventually release him after a visit from Albert's uncle.

Oswald, steadfast in his belief that rescuing an old gentleman in distress could lead to fortune, focuses on Lord Tottenham, a local figure known for his eccentricity. The children devise a plan to stage a rescue by setting their dog Pincher on Lord Tottenham, intending to "rescue" him from the dog's grip. However, the plan backfires, and the children are reprimanded by Lord Tottenham for their ungentlemanly conduct. Despite this, the incident ends amicably, with Lord Tottenham forgiving them and establishing a friendly rapport.

Throughout their adventures, the children grapple with the realities of their financial situation, the absence of their deceased mother, and their father's preoccupation with work. They learn valuable lessons about honesty, integrity, and the consequences of their actions. The narrative is rich with humor, imagination, and the innocence of childhood, capturing the essence of youthful adventure and the desire to make a difference in their world.

In the end, the children's various schemes do not restore their family's fortunes, but they gain wisdom and experience, forming bonds with the people around them, including their neighbor's uncle and Lord Tottenham. The story concludes with a sense of acceptance and the recognition that their adventures, while not financially fruitful, have enriched their lives in other meaningful ways.
