In a quaint New England village, the narrative unfolds with Mr. Langley, a minister, who receives three unsettling revelations that disrupt his otherwise peaceful life. The first is hearing Miss Penny referred to as an old lady, the second is learning that Anna Miller is known as the "other Miller girl," and the third is a more personal shock related to a yellow-haired girl. These revelations set the stage for a story that intertwines the lives of several characters in the village of Farleigh.

The village is depicted with its picturesque church and surrounding nature, which serves as a backdrop for the unfolding drama. Mr. Langley, a minister in his forties, lives a solitary life in the parsonage, his wife Ella Langley being a long-term invalid secluded from the world. Despite his circumstances, Langley has maintained a youthful spirit, though recent events threaten to shatter his inner peace.

Anna Miller, the "other Miller girl," is central to the story. She is characterized by her good nature and a humorous outlook on life. Anna is aware of her position in the village's social hierarchy, often overshadowed by her sister Rusty, who has gone to college. However, Anna's unique perspective and experiences make her a pivotal character in the narrative.

Anna's life has not been easy; she ran away as a child and supported herself in the city. Her experiences have given her a mature understanding of the world, and she returns to Farleigh with a sense of contentment, determined to fill the void left by her sister's absence. Anna's story is one of resilience and an unexpected capacity for joy despite hardships.

The plot thickens with the return of Richard Cartwright, presumed dead, who secretly visits the village he once called home. Cartwright, a man with a troubled past, seeks to reconnect with his son Reuben and old friends without revealing his presence. His journey is one of redemption and reconciliation with a past that includes a stint in prison under a false name to protect his son from the shame of his father's actions.

Alice Lorraine, a newcomer to the village with her mother, becomes entangled in the mystery surrounding Cartwright. She discovers his identity and aids him in his quest, driven by a newfound sense of purpose and connection to the village's past. Alice's relationship with her mother evolves as they adapt to life in Farleigh, moving from a state of isolation to becoming part of the community.

The narrative explores themes of identity, belonging, and the passage of time. Mr. Langley grapples with the realization that his long-dead daughter, Ella May, would have been a grown woman, which forces him to confront his own aging and the passage of time. Anna, in her interactions with Mrs. Langley, attempts to bring light and life back into the parsonage, offering a baby as a Christmas gift to the Langleys, symbolizing hope and renewal.

The story culminates in a series of revelations and reconciliations. Cartwright's presence is eventually revealed, leading to a reunion with his son and a new beginning. Mrs. Langley, inspired by Anna's visits, begins to emerge from her self-imposed exile, reconnecting with the world and her husband. Anna's sacrifice of her hair to support a friend in need underscores her selflessness and the interconnectedness of the village's inhabitants.

Through humor, warmth, and a touch of melancholy, the narrative weaves together the lives of its characters, each seeking redemption and connection in their own way. The village of Farleigh, with its timeless charm and enduring relationships, serves as a microcosm for the human experience, where love, loss, and hope intertwine in the fabric of everyday life.
