   a. ""K.'s discovery of indecent images in law books"": This part is grounded in Chapter 3, event 2, where K. examines law books containing indecent images.

   a. ""The fairness within the legal system is evident through K.'s discovery of legal textbooks in law books"": This part is grounded in Chapter 3, where K. examines law books on the judge's table and finds indecent images and inappropriate content. However, this discovery does not indicate fairness; rather, it suggests corruption or a lack of seriousness in the legal system.
   b. ""The promotion of policemen for their conduct during his arrest"": This part is not grounded in the summary or chapter outline.

""Titorelli's offer to influence judges for an absolute acquittal"": This part is grounded in Chapter 7, where Titorelli explains the complexities of the court system and offers to help K. obtain an apparent acquittal by influencing judges. However, this does not demonstrate fairness; it highlights the manipulation and corruption within the system.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid or meaningful. The claim suggests that these events demonstrate fairness in the legal system, but the events actually highlight corruption, manipulation, and a lack of transparency.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the events described do not support the notion of fairness in the legal system.
