Ralph Hartsook, a young schoolmaster, takes up a challenging teaching position in the Flat Creek district, known for its unruly students and a history of driving away previous teachers. Ralph is determined to succeed despite the physical and psychological challenges he faces from both students and locals. The story unfolds in a rural Indiana setting, where Ralph navigates the complexities of small-town life and its often harsh realities.

Key characters include Ralph Hartsook, the protagonist, who is intelligent, determined, and morally upright. He is initially intimidated by the physical prowess of his students and the daunting reputation of the area. Bud Means, the eldest son of Ralph's landlord, initially seems like a threat but becomes a significant ally. Bud is strong-willed and initially skeptical of Ralph but grows to respect him. Hannah Thomson, the bound girl at Means's, becomes the object of Ralph's affections. She is hardworking, kind, and has a mysterious past involving her family’s downfall. Shocky is Hannah's younger brother, a sensitive and imaginative boy who endears himself to Ralph.

Ralph's primary objective is to maintain order in the school and earn the respect of the community. He also seeks to uncover the truth behind the local robbery and clear his name when he becomes a suspect. His motivations are driven by a desire for justice, personal integrity, and a growing affection for Hannah.

Ralph's investigation into the robbery leads to a confrontation with local criminals, during which he risks his safety to protect the innocent.

The setting of Flat Creek, with its rustic and often harsh environment, plays a significant role in the story.
