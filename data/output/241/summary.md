For many years, the Southern United States has been known for its beautiful quadroon women, the offspring of white slaveholders and their enslaved women. These women, like Agnes, a mulatto owned by John Graves in Richmond, Virginia, often aspired to be the mistresses of white men, as there were no incentives for slave women to remain chaste. Agnes, claiming to be the daughter of an American Senator, was a laundress with two daughters, Isabella and Marion, whom she raised to be ladies.

Henry Linwood, a wealthy young man from Richmond, became enamored with Isabella at a "negro ball," where white men mingled with quadroon women. Henry promised to buy Isabella and her family to free them from slavery, but after his father's death, the family was put up for sale. Henry bought Isabella but failed to secure the freedom of her mother and sister, who were sold to a slave trader.

Isabella was taken to a secluded cottage by Henry, where she bore a daughter, Clotelle. However, Henry's interest waned, and he married a white woman, Gertrude Miller, leaving Isabella and Clotelle to fend for themselves. Isabella was eventually sold to a New Orleans slave trader, while Clotelle was left in the care of Gertrude's cruel mother, Mrs. Miller. Clotelle's beauty drew the attention of many, and she was eventually sold to a man who took her to France, where she found freedom.

Meanwhile, Jerome, a slave from the same region, escaped to Canada with the help of a Quaker family after being sold multiple times. He worked diligently to earn money to rescue Clotelle but learned she had been sold to New Orleans. Jerome decided to leave America, disillusioned by the cruelty of slavery.

Clotelle, now free and living in France, married Antoine Devenant, but he died in India. She returned to France, where she was reunited with Jerome, who had also settled there. They married and lived a happy life in Europe, away from the oppression of slavery.

Henry Linwood, Clotelle's father, who had become disillusioned with the institution of slavery, resolved to return to Virginia to free his remaining slaves. However, the outbreak of the Civil War and the subsequent emancipation of slaves rendered his plans unnecessary.

Clotelle, now known as the "Angel of Mercy," devoted her life to helping freed slaves in the United States, establishing schools and providing aid. Her journey from a slave in the South to a respected figure in the fight for freedom and equality highlighted the resilience and strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity.
