Rider Haggard,20,114951,,False,False,False,,,,"The narrative begins with Allan Quatermain, a seasoned hunter and trader based in Durban, Natal, who is approached by Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good. They seek Quatermain's expertise to help locate Sir Henry's brother, George Neville, who disappeared while searching for the legendary Solomon's Mines. Quatermain, initially reluctant due to the dangers involved, is persuaded by Curtis's generous offer and the promise to secure his son's future.

The journey commences from Durban, with the group traveling by wagon through the African wilderness. They face numerous challenges, including the treacherous tsetse fly-infested regions, which force them to abandon their wagon and proceed on foot. Along the way, they recruit Umbopa, a mysterious and dignified Zulu, as their guide and servant. Umbopa's presence becomes increasingly significant as the story unfolds.

As they venture deeper into the unknown, the group encounters various wildlife and faces the harsh realities of the African landscape. A notable adventure includes a dangerous elephant hunt, during which they witness the brutal realities of survival in the wild. The journey tests their endurance and resourcefulness, but they press on, driven by the hope of discovering the fabled mines and locating Neville.

Their path leads them to Kukuanaland, a mysterious and isolated kingdom surrounded by mountains. They are guided by Infadoos, a Kukuana chief, who reveals the kingdom's rich history and its connection to the ancient mines. The travelers learn of the tyrannical King Twala, who seized the throne by murdering his twin brother, the rightful king. Twala's rule is marked by cruelty and fear, enforced by the witch doctress Gagool.

Upon reaching Twala's capital, Loo, the group witnesses the king's brutal justice and the awe-inspiring power he wields over his people. Quatermain and his companions are introduced to the court, where they must navigate the dangerous political landscape. They learn of the annual witch-hunt, a gruesome event where suspected traitors are executed to maintain Twala's reign of terror.

As they gain the trust of Infadoos and the people, the travelers discover that Umbopa is, in fact, Ignosi, the rightful heir to the Kukuana throne. Ignosi reveals his true identity and his intention to overthrow Twala, with the support of Quatermain, Curtis, and Good. The group becomes embroiled in a civil war, leading to a climactic battle where Twala is defeated, and Ignosi ascends to the throne.

With Ignosi's help, the group gains access to Solomon's Mines, hidden within the mountains. They navigate through treacherous passages and encounter the chilling remains of previous explorers, including the mummified body of José da Silvestra, who left behind a map that guided them. Inside the treasure chamber, they find an unimaginable wealth of diamonds and gold.

Their victory, however, is marred by tragedy. Foulata, a beautiful Kukuana woman who had grown close to Good, is fatally wounded by Gagool during their escape from the mines. The group narrowly escapes being trapped forever, as the treasure chamber seals itself, leaving behind the riches they can never fully claim.

Returning to the surface, the travelers are hailed as heroes. Ignosi honors his promise to Quatermain and his friends, ensuring their safe passage back to civilization. They leave Kukuanaland with a modest share of diamonds, enough to secure their futures. The journey back is arduous, but they eventually reach Durban, where they part ways with Ignosi, now a wise and just ruler.

The narrative concludes with Quatermain reflecting on the adventure, the bonds formed, and the sacrifices made. Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good return to England, while Quatermain considers his future, enriched not only by the diamonds but by the experiences and friendships forged in the heart of Africa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Angel and the Author, and Others",2368,Jerome K. Jerome,20,66769,,False,False,False,,,,"In a whimsical and satirical exploration of societal norms, the narrative unfolds through a series of chapters, each delving into different aspects of human behavior and cultural phenomena. The story begins with a dream of a man flying with the Recording Angel, reflecting on his virtuous deeds and the irony of them being recorded as sins. This sets the tone for a critique of societal hypocrisy, particularly during Christmas when people perform noble deeds for appearances rather than genuine goodwill.

The narrative then shifts to a humorous examination of waiters, contrasting the slow, dignified British railway refreshment-room waiter with the more dynamic foreign waiter, who often struggles with language barriers and cultural misunderstandings. This serves as a metaphor for the broader theme of communication and the challenges of navigating different social expectations.

Women and their evolving roles are another focal point, as the narrative critiques the superficiality of societal expectations and the constraints placed on women by traditional roles. The story highlights the absurdity of these expectations through various anecdotes, questioning the notion of the ""higher life"" that some women seek, which often amounts to trivial pursuits rather than meaningful contributions.

A recurring theme is the critique of societal conventions, such as the institution of marriage, which is portrayed both romantically and comically. The narrative questions the idealized notions of love and partnership, suggesting that real-life relationships require more than just adherence to societal norms.

The narrative also touches on the nature of heroism, mocking the unrealistic portrayal of heroes in popular literature and questioning the societal obsession with superficial markers of gentility, such as clothing and manners. This critique extends to the depiction of ghosts and spirits, where the author expresses skepticism about the dull and unimaginative nature of supposed supernatural encounters.

A philosophical thread runs through the narrative, exploring the concept of suffering and the human tendency to seek meaning in adversity. The narrative suggests that true wisdom lies in accepting life's inevitable challenges with grace and humor.

Finally, the narrative addresses the issue of work and leisure in modern society, lamenting the lack of meaningful engagement among those with the privilege of leisure. It questions the societal value placed on sports and recreation, arguing that the privileged class often squanders its potential to contribute to the greater good.

Despite his mysterious past and reluctance to divulge personal details, Brown is taken in by Seth and becomes his assistant. The two men form an uneasy alliance, each hiding their own secrets and pasts.

Seth, a former sea captain, is a self-proclaimed woman-hater, a sentiment stemming from his troubled marriage to a woman named Emeline. He left her after a series of misunderstandings and disputes involving her brother-in-law, Bennie D., who manipulated and caused discord in their marriage. Seth has since sought refuge in the isolation of the lighthouse, away from women and society.

Brown, on the other hand, is also escaping from his past. He is the disinherited son of a wealthy man, having left his privileged life after refusing an arranged marriage to a girl he did not love. His fall overboard was both literal and metaphorical, representing his break from his former life. He finds solace in the anonymity of the lighthouse, though he struggles with his own loneliness and the monotony of the job.

The arrival of two women at a nearby bungalow—Ruth Graham, an artist, and her housekeeper, Mrs. Bascom—complicates matters. Brown, despite his vow to avoid women, finds himself drawn to Ruth.

Doña Perfecta,2462,Benito Pérez Galdós,32,106950,,False,False,False,,,,"In a small town called Orbajosa, the narrative unfolds with the arrival of Pepe Rey, a young engineer from Madrid, who comes to visit his aunt, Doña Perfecta, and his cousin, Rosario. Pepe's visit is not just familial; it is also a potential courtship, as there is an understanding that he might marry Rosario. The setting is a place of stark contrasts, with its rich historical backdrop and deeply rooted traditions juxtaposed against Pepe's modern, scientific outlook.

Pepe is warmly received by Doña Perfecta, who, despite her outward kindness, harbors a complex and manipulative nature. She is a deeply religious woman, and her views are in stark opposition to Pepe’s progressive and scientific mindset. The town of Orbajosa itself is steeped in religious fervor and suspicion of outsiders, which sets the stage for conflict.

As Pepe settles in, he begins to develop a deep affection for Rosario, who reciprocates his feelings. However, their budding romance is overshadowed by Doña Perfecta's growing hostility towards Pepe. She perceives his modern ideas as a threat to her traditional values and the religious sanctity of her household. This tension is exacerbated by the influence of Don Inocencio, the local Penitentiary, who shares Doña Perfecta's conservative views and becomes an ally in her schemes against Pepe.

The narrative weaves through a series of misunderstandings and manipulations. Doña Perfecta, under the guise of protecting her daughter, orchestrates a campaign to discredit Pepe, painting him as an atheist and a disruptor. The townspeople, influenced by their respect for Doña Perfecta and their own prejudices, begin to view Pepe with suspicion. This culminates in a series of legal and social obstacles designed to frustrate his intentions.

Pepe's struggle is not just against Doña Perfecta but also against the broader societal forces of Orbajosa that resist change and cling to their insular ways. Despite the mounting pressure, Pepe remains determined to win Rosario’s hand and prove his worth.

The conflict reaches a climax when Pepe, driven by love and desperation, plans a clandestine meeting with Rosario. However, Doña Perfecta, ever vigilant, discovers the plan and enlists the help of Caballuco, a local strongman, to thwart Pepe. The encounter turns violent, resulting in Pepe being shot, an event that Doña Perfecta manipulates to appear as a suicide.

The aftermath is tragic. Rosario, overwhelmed by grief and the machinations of her mother, loses her sanity. Doña Perfecta, while achieving her immediate goal of separating Pepe and Rosario, is left with the hollow victory of a broken family and a daughter who can no longer recognize her.

Through the lens of this personal tragedy, the novel explores themes of tradition versus progress, the destructive power of fanaticism, and the tragic consequences of pride and manipulation. Pepe Rey’s story is a poignant commentary on the struggle between old and new, and the human cost of rigid adherence to outdated beliefs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Lani People,2509,Jesse F. Bone,20,85456,,False,False,False,,,,"Jac Kennon, a recent graduate in veterinary medicine, arrives on the planet Kardon, where he is offered an unusually high-paying job with Outworld Enterprises Incorporated. The planet is home to the Lani, a humanoid species with a striking resemblance to humans but distinguished by their tails. The Lani are treated as livestock and are integral to the economic operations of the company. Kennon is hired to manage the health of the Lani, but he quickly becomes embroiled in the ethical and moral implications of their treatment.

Upon arrival, Kennon meets Alexander X. M. Alexander, the entrepreneur who runs Outworld Enterprises. Alexander is a shrewd businessman who controls the company with an iron grip, despite opposition from his family, who also have stakes in the business. The family dynamics are complex, with members like Douglas, Alexander's cousin, causing disruptions and others like Eloise, Alexander's sister, exhibiting predatory behavior.

Kennon is introduced to the Lani and is initially shocked by their human-like appearance and the conditions in which they live. He learns that the Lani are bred and trained for various tasks, including labor and export. The island of Flora, where the Lani reside, is a self-sufficient agricultural hub, and the Lani are crucial to its operations.

As Kennon settles into his role, he discovers an outbreak of liver flukes among the Lani, a problem that had been overlooked by his predecessor, Dr. Williamson, due to his failing health. The fluke infestation poses a significant threat to the Lani population, and Kennon is tasked with eradicating it. He approaches the problem methodically, understanding that it requires breaking the parasite's life cycle, a task complicated by the Lani's unique biology and the island's isolated ecosystem.

Throughout his work, Kennon grapples with the ethical implications of the Lani's status. Officially declared non-human by a Brotherhood court, the Lani are treated as animals, yet their intelligence and human-like characteristics challenge this classification. Kennon's interactions with Copper, a Lani who becomes his secretary, further complicate his feelings. Copper is intelligent, perceptive, and challenges Kennon's preconceptions about the Lani.

Kennon's investigation into the Lani's origins reveals that they might be the descendants of human missionaries who landed on Kardon millennia ago. This revelation has the potential to redefine the Lani's status, but it also puts Kennon at odds with Alexander and the company's interests. The situation is further complicated by the presence of Alexander's family, who have their own agendas and could disrupt Kennon's efforts.

Kennon's journey is one of moral and ethical discovery as he navigates the complexities of his role, the Lani's treatment, and the potential implications of their true origins. His struggle is not only with the biological challenges posed by the fluke infestation but also with the broader question of what it means to be human and the responsibilities that come with that understanding. As he works to solve the immediate health crisis, Kennon must also consider the long-term implications of his discoveries for the Lani and for the human society that has subjugated them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trent's Last Case,2568,E. C. Bentley,16,102534,,False,False,False,,,,"Sigsbee Manderson, a powerful and enigmatic American financier, is found dead with a gunshot wound to the eye in the grounds of his English estate, White Gables. The circumstances surrounding his death are mysterious, with no weapon found nearby and recent marks of a struggle on his wrists. The case attracts the attention of Philip Trent, a celebrated detective and artist, who is called upon to investigate the crime.

Trent arrives at the scene and begins his investigation, navigating through a web of complex relationships and hidden motives. He learns that Manderson had been acting strangely in the weeks leading up to his death, showing signs of anxiety and paranoia. His relationship with his wife, Mabel Manderson, had become strained, with an unexplained distance growing between them. Despite this, Mabel is composed and cooperative during the investigation, though she is clearly affected by her husband's death.

Trent interviews various people connected to Manderson, including his two secretaries: Calvin Bunner, an American with a sharp business acumen, and John Marlowe, an Englishman responsible for Manderson's personal affairs. Bunner suggests that Manderson might have been targeted due to his ruthless business dealings in America, which had made him many enemies. Marlowe, on the other hand, is seen as a potential suspect due to his proximity to Manderson and his mysterious late-night errand to Southampton on the night of the murder.

Trent's investigation reveals several puzzling details: Manderson's shoes show signs of having been worn by someone else, his dental plate was left in his room despite him being fully dressed, and a large sum of money was found in his possession without explanation. These clues, combined with the absence of a weapon, lead Trent to suspect foul play rather than suicide.

As Trent delves deeper, he uncovers a complex plot involving impersonation and deception. He discovers that Marlowe had been sent on a fabricated mission to Southampton, while Manderson had orchestrated his own death to frame Marlowe. The financier's mental state, influenced by paranoia and a desire for revenge against perceived enemies, had driven him to this elaborate scheme. Manderson had staged his own murder, intending for Marlowe to be accused and executed for the crime.

In the end, Trent decides to suppress his findings, opting to protect Mabel from further scandal and pain. He concludes that the truth, if revealed, would serve no justice and only cause more harm.

The case leaves Trent with a sense of disillusionment about the nature of justice and the complexities of human motives. He resolves to retire from detective work, recognizing the limitations of his own understanding and the potential consequences of exposing hidden truths. The Manderson case becomes a testament to the tangled web of human emotions and the unpredictable outcomes of even the most carefully laid plans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This incident sets the tone for Shelton's journey through a society that is both familiar and alien to him.

Shelton, recently engaged to Antonia Dennant, is caught between his love for her and his growing awareness of society's hypocrisies.

As Shelton navigates his engagement, he becomes increasingly aware of the chasm between his own ideals and those of the world around him.

Throughout his journey, Shelton is haunted by encounters with people who challenge his perceptions. Ferrand, a vagabond with a sharp intellect and a disdain for societal norms, becomes a recurring figure in Shelton's life. Ferrand's presence forces Shelton to confront the superficiality and complacency of his own social circle, which includes characters like the Dennants and their guests, who are more concerned with appearances and propriety than with genuine human connection.

As Shelton spends time at Holm Oaks, the Dennant family estate, he observes the genteel life of the upper classes, filled with tennis matches, dinner parties, and polite conversation. Yet, beneath the surface, he senses a lack of authenticity and a reluctance to engage with the deeper issues of life. Antonia, though intelligent and spirited, is bound by the expectations of her upbringing, and Shelton struggles to reconcile his love for her with his growing disillusionment.

The incident, combined with Ferrand's departure and the superficiality of a wedding he attends, deepens Shelton's internal conflict.

Shelton's journey is marked by moments of introspection and encounters with a variety of characters who symbolize different aspects of society. From the pragmatic and detached Mr. Paramor, his uncle, to the lively but shallow guests at the Casserols' dinner, each interaction reveals the complexities and contradictions of the world Shelton inhabits.

The novel ends with Shelton writing a letter to Antonia, releasing her from their engagement and acknowledging the need for both of them to find their own paths.

Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc — Volume 1,2874,Mark Twain,35,108991,,False,False,False,,,,"The story begins with the Sieur Louis de Conte, who was born in Neufchateau in 1410, two years before Joan of Arc was born in Domremy. His family, Armagnacs—French patriots—fled from Paris due to the Burgundian party, who supported the English. Louis's family suffered greatly, losing everything except his father's small nobility. In Neufchateau, Louis found a region of comparative quiet, unlike the chaos and violence of Paris. At five years old, he witnessed the disaster of Agincourt, which left France prostrate, and saw his family butchered by raiders. He was sent to Domremy to live with a priest, Guillaume Fronte, and his loving housekeeper, who became like a mother to him. 

In Domremy, Louis grew up with Joan and other village children, forming a close bond. The village was staunchly Armagnac, fiercely hating the English and Burgundians. Despite the political turmoil, their childhood was filled with simple joys and innocence.

As Joan grew, she became increasingly serious and thoughtful, burdened by the plight of France. At fourteen, she began to experience visions and hear voices which she believed were from God, instructing her to save France. Despite the skepticism and ridicule from her village, Joan was resolute in her mission. She eventually persuaded her uncle to take her to Vaucouleurs, where she sought an audience with the governor, Robert de Baudricourt, to gain support for her divine mission.

Joan's persistence and conviction eventually won over the governor, and she was sent to the King. Along the way, her presence and faith inspired those around her, including Louis and other childhood friends. Her journey was marked by miraculous events and divine guidance, as she gathered an army and led them to victories against the English, culminating in the lifting of the siege of Orleans.

Throughout her campaign, Joan remained humble and devoted to her mission, despite the growing fame and adulation. She was ennobled by the King but refused any personal gain, focusing solely on her divine task to crown the Dauphin and drive the English out of France.

Joan's story is one of unwavering faith, courage, and selflessness. Her leadership and victories inspired a nation, and her legacy as the Maid of Orleans continues to be celebrated. Her life, marked by both triumph and tragedy, remains a testament to the power of belief and the impact one person can have on the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Coming of Cuculain,5092,Standish O'Grady,16,56523,,False,False,False,,,,"In a time when giants and heroes roamed the earth, the Red Branch warriors gathered for a grand feast in their vast hall at Emain Macha. The hall, a monumental structure built by the sons of Dithorba under the command of Macha, was a testament to the might and grandeur of the Ultonians. The gathering was a celebration of their unity and strength, with King Concobar Mac Nessa presiding over the festivities. The mighty Fergus Mac Roy, a colossus among men, sat at the other end, symbolizing the strength and valor of the Red Branch.

During the feast, the bard sang of past glories, stirring the warriors' spirits. However, Fergus, filled with dissatisfaction, challenged the assembly, urging them to conquer all of Ireland and extend their dominion to the realms of Lir. His call to arms was met with enthusiasm, and the warriors, inspired by his words, sang their battle songs with fervor. Concobar, recognizing the martial ardor, suggested consulting Cathvah the Ard-Druid for omens and guidance. Cathvah prophesied the coming of a child who would bring eternal fame to the Ultonians, but also warned of future strife among them.

Amidst these prophecies, a child named Deirdre was born to the chief poet of Ulla, her birth marked by ominous signs. The Druids foretold that her beauty would bring great sorrow to the Ultonians, advising her to be isolated from the world. She was raised in solitude by her nurse, Levarcam, in a remote forest dun. As Deirdre grew, her beauty became unmatched, and she longed for companionship. Her dreams of a handsome youth led Levarcam, moved by love and compassion, to promise her a meeting with Naysi, son of Usna, a brave and noble warrior.

Naysi, while hunting, encountered Deirdre, and they fell deeply in love. With the help of his brothers, Anli and Ardane, Naysi decided to elope with Deirdre, defying the Ultonians' decree. They fled to the land of the Albanagh, where they found refuge and performed heroic deeds.

Back in Ulster, the abduction of Deirdre sparked a conflict between King Concobar and Fergus Mac Roy. Fergus, loyal to the Clan Usna, opposed Concobar's harsh laws and sought to protect the lovers. The disagreement escalated into a civil war, leading to Fergus's rebellion and eventual exile. He and his followers joined Queen Meave of Connaught, who later attempted to invade Ulster, only to be thwarted by the young hero Cuculain.

Cuculain, also known as Setanta, was a prodigious warrior, the promised child of prophecy. From a young age, he exhibited extraordinary strength and skill. Raised by his mother Dectera and nursed by the druidess Dethcaen, Setanta was destined for greatness. His journey to Emain Macha was marked by divine encounters and trials, including his first martial feat, where he defended himself against the Red Branch boys, earning their respect and leadership.

As Setanta grew, he became known as Cuculain, the Hound of Culain, after an encounter with the smith Culain's fierce dog, which he slew in self-defense. To atone, he offered to guard Culain's property until a replacement was found, showcasing his sense of honor and responsibility.

Cuculain's prowess continued to grow, culminating in his knighting ceremony, where he was gifted the legendary horses Liath Macha and Black Shanglan. His fame spread as he defended Ulster single-handedly against Queen Meave's forces, cementing his place as the greatest hero of the Red Branch.

Throughout these events, the themes of destiny, prophecy, and the consequences of love and loyalty intertwined, shaping the lives of the Ultonians and their legendary heroes. The tales of Cuculain, Deirdre, and the Red Branch warriors remain etched in the annals of time, celebrated for their courage, tragedy, and enduring legacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Larry, needing to leave due to health issues, entrusts Eric with his school and living arrangements, which include staying with the kind-hearted Williamsons.

Eric's life in Lindsay is divided between his duties at school and his growing fascination with the mysterious Kilmeny Gordon, a beautiful and mute girl he encounters in an abandoned orchard.

Her mother, Margaret Gordon, once a vibrant woman, withdrew from society after a scandal involving her marriage to a man who was already married.

Eric, however, is enchanted by her beauty, both physical and spiritual, and he becomes determined to help her overcome her muteness. He consults his friend, Dr. David Baker, a specialist in throat and voice disorders, who suggests that Kilmeny's inability to speak might be psychological rather than physical.

As Eric and Kilmeny's relationship deepens, Eric finds himself torn between his duty to return to his own life and his desire to stay with Kilmeny.

Despite his advancing age, he finds himself embroiled in a tale of intrigue, danger, and ancient mysteries. This story begins as Quatermain reflects on the nature of life and death, pondering whether it is better to live or die and musing on the reluctance of even the most devout to embrace death. He then delves into the narrative of his adventure, which he recorded during his idle hours in a strange land—England.

The adventure begins with a recollection of a journey he undertook with Lord Ragnall, whose wife had been kidnapped in Egypt. The kidnappers were priests of a tribe who believed her to be the priestess of their worship due to a birthmark resembling a young moon on her breast. This worship was rooted in Ancient Egyptian beliefs, and the tribe saw her as a personification of the goddess Isis. The expedition to rescue her was fraught with danger, but ultimately successful. Before leaving the Kendah country, Lady Ragnall was given ancient papyrus rolls and a herb called Taduki, known for inducing visions or clairvoyance.

Quatermain recalls a conversation with Lady Ragnall about the Taduki, where she suggested that they might one day use it to see visions of their past or future lives. This idea resurfaces when Quatermain attends a charity dinner and meets a scientist who studies herbs with similar properties. Intrigued by the possibilities, Quatermain considers experimenting with Taduki.

The narrative shifts to Quatermain's return to England, where he is drawn back into the world of adventure when he receives a letter from Lady Ragnall. She invites him to Ragnall Castle, where she reveals that her husband, Lord Ragnall, died in Egypt during an excavation of a temple dedicated to Isis. This temple, remarkably well-preserved due to being buried in sand, contained a statue of Isis that had been destroyed in a sand collapse, killing Lord Ragnall.

Despite his initial reluctance, Quatermain is persuaded to partake in the Taduki ritual with Lady Ragnall.

He is engaged to Anna Hethbridge, a woman he does not love, simply because of her fortune. However, upon discovering a wealthier prospect, he decides to abandon Anna. When a newspaper mistakenly reports him dead, Seymour chooses to let the error stand, using it as an opportunity to end his engagement without confrontation. His decision is fueled by a cold calculation rather than any sense of guilt or conscience.

Anna Hethbridge, left in shock by the news of Seymour’s supposed death, soon marries James Edward Agar, a wealthy squire, and moves to Stagholme, where she becomes stepmother to his young son, Jem. Her marriage is a hasty decision, possibly driven by a need for stability and comfort after Seymour's betrayal. However, Anna’s life at Stagholme is not entirely fulfilling, and she finds herself at odds with her stepson, Jem, whose straightforward honesty contrasts sharply with her own nature.

Years later, Jem Agar grows into a capable and respected officer in the Indian army. He is stationed on the frontier, tasked with holding a strategic position with a small force of Goorkhas. His leadership and bravery earn him admiration, but he is reported dead after a disastrous engagement. Unbeknownst to his family, Jem survives and is persuaded by his commanding officer, General Seymour Michael, to remain ""dead"" to the world for strategic reasons.

Meanwhile, Dora remains steadfast in her feelings for Jem, whom she believes to be dead.

As time passes, Jem’s mission is completed, and he returns to England, only to find that Seymour Michael has not informed his family of his survival, as promised. This betrayal leads to a confrontation where Jem demands explanations. The truth about Seymour’s manipulations and deceit is revealed, resulting in a dramatic showdown.

Arthur, driven by a deep-seated hatred for Seymour Michael—a hatred he seems to have been born with—confronts him violently, leading to Seymour’s death. This act, though committed in a fit of madness, is understood by those present as the culmination of a lifetime of deceit and betrayal on Seymour’s part.

In the aftermath, Jem is reunited with Dora, and they find solace and happiness in each other.

The ship is primarily used for trade in the southern seas, but it's heavily armed due to the threat of pirates. The story is set in motion when a passenger, Mr. Jeorling, a curious and adventurous American, seeks passage on the _Halbrane_ to leave the remote Kerguelen Islands.

Jeorling learns about Captain Len Guy's obsession with the fate of his brother, William Guy, the captain of the lost ship _Jane_, which disappeared in the Antarctic seas.

The Boss of Little Arcady,10358,Harry Leon Wilson,30,124653,,False,False,False,,,,"In a quaint town of Little Arcady, life unfolds with a blend of humor, drama, and the unexpected. The narrative is set in the late 19th century, capturing the essence of a small community where every individual's actions ripple through the social fabric. Central to the story is Colonel J. Rodney Potts, a character whose presence becomes both a comedic and dramatic catalyst for the town's events.

The tale begins with Potts, a lawyer of questionable repute, who finds himself at the heart of a local scandal. After an incident where he falls into a mill-race, Potts becomes the subject of ridicule and gossip, leading to a humorous yet biting editorial in the local newspaper, the _Little Arcady Argus_, run by the witty and somewhat sardonic Solon Denney. Solon, known for his peculiar blend of seriousness and frivolity, uses his newspaper as a platform to both inform and entertain the townsfolk, often with a touch of satire.

As the story progresses, Potts, despite his dubious reputation, decides to run for the position of County Judge, much to the amusement and horror of the town. His candidacy is a strategic move by the Democratic leaders to split the Republican vote, but it also becomes a personal crusade for Potts, who seems oblivious to the town's disdain. His campaign is bolstered by a series of letters from prominent citizens, including Asa Bundy, the local banker, and Marvin Chislett, a store owner, all of whom have been coerced or tricked into writing glowing testimonials about him.

Meanwhile, Solon Denney, who initially orchestrated Potts's departure from the town with a clever scheme involving a purse of money and letters of recommendation, finds himself in a bind. The town, once grateful for Solon's cunning plan to rid them of Potts, now turns to him again to solve the new problem of Potts's candidacy. Solon, known as the ""Boss of Little Arcady,"" faces pressure to maintain his reputation and influence.

In a twist of fate, Solon receives a letter from Mrs. J. Rodney Potts, who announces her intention to join her husband in Little Arcady. Solon sees an opportunity in this development and, with the help of Billy Durgin, a young and enthusiastic amateur detective, he sets a plan in motion. Billy, who idolizes fictional detectives and yearns for adventure, is tasked with delivering the news of Mrs. Potts's impending arrival to the Colonel.

The revelation of Mrs. Potts's arrival sends Potts into a panic. The prospect of facing his wife, whom he had possibly left under less than honorable circumstances, is too much for him to bear. Potts hastily borrows money, purchases a bottle of whiskey, and leaves town on a freight train, effectively ending his campaign and his troublesome presence in Little Arcady.

The denouement sees Solon Denney vindicated, his reputation as the clever manipulator of town affairs restored. The townspeople, including the skeptical Westley Keyts, acknowledge Solon's deft handling of the situation, and life in Little Arcady returns to its gentle, humorous rhythm. The narrative, rich with character and local color, captures the charm and idiosyncrasies of small-town life, where every action, no matter how trivial, can have significant consequences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Algonquin Indian Tales,10891,Egerton Ryerson Young,25,84547,,False,False,False,,,,"In a northern home, two children, Sagastaookemou (""Sunrise Gentleman"") and Minnehaha (""Laughing Waters""), are gently taken by two pagan Saulteaux Indians, Souwanas and Jakoos, to a wigwam near Lake Winnipeg. The children, familiar and unafraid of the Indians, enjoy a feast with other native children. This novel experience includes wild ducks, rabbits, and partridges cooked over a fire, a stark contrast to their usual meals. The day is filled with storytelling, and Souwanas, known as a storyteller, captivates them with tales of Nanahboozhoo, a mythical figure capable of shape-shifting and leaving marks on nature. One story explains why the birch tree is scarred and why the raccoon has rings on its tail, attributing these features to Nanahboozhoo's adventures and mishaps.

As winter approaches, the arrival of the Christmas packet brings excitement and gifts to the mission, even in the harsh cold. The children, Sagastao and Minnehaha, eagerly share their gifts with Souwanas, who reciprocates with stories. One tale recounts how Nanahboozhoo helped the Ojibways learn to make maple sugar, a sweet story fitting the children's request. The narrative includes Nanahboozhoo's cleverness in overcoming challenges and aiding the tribes, despite his mischievous nature.

In another chapter, Sagastao, recovering from illness, inquires about the origin of sickness. Mary, the children's nurse, promises to tell him the legend once he's stronger. The story unfolds with animals holding councils to decide how to retaliate against humans for their cruelty, resulting in diseases. Bears, deer, fish, snakes, birds, and insects each decide on a unique way to afflict humans, explaining various ailments and fears. This tale illustrates the interconnectedness and ancient beliefs of the natural world.

The narrative continues with a naming ceremony for the children's baby sister, born among the Saulteaux. After much deliberation, the tribe names her Souwanaquenapeke, meaning ""The Voice of the South Wind Birds,"" honoring her birthplace and the spring season. Later, during a canoe trip, Mary tells the children about the discovery of medicine, attributed to the ground squirrel, who revealed healing plants to humans after animals sent diseases among them. This story underscores the theme of gratitude and respect for nature's gifts.

Souwanas shares a tale of Waubenoo, a kind-hearted maiden pursued by the cruel Gray Wolf. Nanahboozhoo, disguised, aids her by teaching Gray Wolf a lesson, highlighting themes of bravery and justice. In a subsequent story, Waubenoo is transformed into a bird, the Whisky Jack, after Gray Wolf's treachery is revealed, illustrating the consequences of deceit and the enduring spirit of kindness.

The children's curiosity leads to a story about the wolverine, whose legs were shortened after a race with a rock, symbolizing the punishment for conceit. Another tale reveals how twin children of the Sun rid the earth of monsters, showcasing bravery and the triumph of good over evil. As spring arrives, Souwanas recounts how Nanahboozhoo destroyed a great sea monster, Mooshekinnebik, bringing safety to the people and demonstrating his heroic nature.

In the summer, the children learn about Nanahboozhoo's adventures, including his ride on a buzzard that ends with a fall, explaining why the buzzard has no feathers on its head.

The origin of tobacco is also attributed to Nanahboozhoo's cunning, reflecting his complex character. As the seasons change, the children delight in these stories, which blend humor, morality, and cultural heritage, enriching their understanding of the world and the myths that shape it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They plan to reconnect over dinner to share their autobiographies and catch up on their lives since they last met.

The narrative then shifts to a legal case involving Reuben Hornby, who is accused of stealing a valuable parcel of diamonds from his uncle, John Hornby's business. The diamonds were placed in a safe by John Hornby, and the next morning, they were missing. The only clue is a thumbprint in blood found on a piece of paper inside the safe, which experts identify as Reuben's. Despite the overwhelming evidence against him, Reuben maintains his innocence and seeks Thorndyke's help.

Miss Juliet Gibson, a close family friend of the Hornbys, also believes in Reuben's innocence and offers financial support for his defense. She shares with Jervis her observations of the Hornby family dynamics, revealing that Walter Hornby, another nephew, has expressed romantic interest in her, but she is not engaged to him.

Thorndyke and Jervis investigate the case, focusing on the thumbprint evidence. They visit Scotland Yard to examine the print and discuss the possibility of forgery. Thorndyke demonstrates that it is possible to create a counterfeit thumbprint indistinguishable from the original, suggesting that the evidence against Reuben might be fabricated.

Throughout the investigation, Thorndyke remains secretive about his findings, even to Jervis, who assists him. Meanwhile, Jervis becomes increasingly fond of Juliet, though he is aware of the complications due to Reuben's situation.

As the trial approaches, Thorndyke and his team prepare their defense, focusing on the possibility that someone with access to Reuben's thumbprint could have forged the evidence.

This revelation leads to Reuben's acquittal, as the jury finds the evidence against him insufficient.

The narrative concludes with Reuben's release and the restoration of his reputation. Jervis reflects on the complexities of the case and his own feelings for Juliet, who remains a close friend and ally throughout the ordeal.

Felix, a contemplative and scholarly young man, is often at odds with his more physically robust and outgoing brother, Oliver. Their father, once a respected warrior, has retreated into a life of mechanical invention and agriculture, leaving the family vulnerable to the machinations of court politics.

Felix dreams of exploration and independence, constructing a canoe for a secret voyage on the great Lake that now dominates the center of the land. The Lake, formed by the backflow of ancient rivers like the Thames and Severn, is a vast body of fresh water, teeming with fish and dotted with islands. Yet, it also serves as a conduit for the Irish and Welsh invaders, who vie for control of the territories around its shores.

The social order is maintained through a rigid class system, where literacy is the privilege of the nobility, and the majority of the population lives in servitude.

As he ventures into the Lake, he encounters the ruins of ancient cities, now overgrown and forgotten, their secrets lost to time. These explorations are not without peril; the marshes of the old metropolis are deadly, shrouded in toxic vapors that claim the lives of those who dare to search for the treasures of the past.

Griggs,20,74401,,False,False,False,,,,"The narrative unfolds with the story of Belton Piedmont, a young African American boy growing up in Winchester, Virginia, in the post-Civil War era. Belton's mother, Mrs. Hannah Piedmont, is determined to provide her children with an education despite the family's poverty and the challenges they face as African Americans in the South. Belton attends a school for colored children, taught by Tiberius Gracchus Leonard, a white man who harbors a deep-seated prejudice against his black students, particularly targeting Belton with his ire while showing favoritism towards Bernard Belgrave, a mixed-race student.

Bernard, unlike Belton, enjoys the privileges of wealth and a supportive family environment, thanks to his mother, Fairfax Belgrave, who is revealed to be the secret wife of a prominent white senator. Bernard's upbringing is marked by a rich intellectual environment, which complements his formal education, first in Winchester and later at Harvard University, where he excels both academically and socially.

As Belton and Bernard grow, they become emblematic of the broader struggle for African American rights and recognition in a society rife with racial prejudice. Belton, despite the harsh treatment from Leonard, becomes a brilliant student, his talents recognized widely after his graduation speech garners national attention. This recognition leads to a fortuitous sponsorship by a sympathetic white editor, Mr. V.M. King, who funds Belton's college education at Stowe University, a hub for the education of African Americans in the South.

At Stowe University, Belton's leadership qualities and rebellious spirit come to the fore as he organizes a successful student protest demanding equal treatment for a black faculty member. This act of defiance marks a turning point in his life, instilling in him a deep commitment to racial equality. Meanwhile, Bernard, driven by a personal quest to legitimize his family and his own status, enters the political arena, ultimately securing a seat in Congress through a contested election, aided by the cunning and morally ambiguous Leonard.

His death, orchestrated by Bernard, who assumes leadership of the Imperium, marks a profound moment of sacrifice and underscores the ideological divides within the African American community regarding the pursuit of equality.

In the end, personal motivations, historical forces, and the quest for justice intertwine, painting a vivid picture of the African American struggle during a transformative period in American history. The narrative serves as a poignant exploration of the costs of leadership, the complexities of racial identity, and the enduring fight for civil rights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stories from Le Morte D'Arthur and the Mabinogion,15551,Beatrice E. Clay,38,74117,,False,False,False,,,,"Long ago, in the realm of Britain, King Uther Pendragon ruled with might but was troubled by unrequited love for Igraine of Cornwall. Falling ill from his heartache, Uther was visited by the powerful magician Merlin, who promised to help him win Igraine's love in exchange for their future son. Uther agreed, and Merlin used his magic to transform Uther's appearance, enabling him to marry Igraine. Their son, Arthur, was born and secretly given to Merlin, who entrusted him to Sir Ector to be raised alongside his son Kay, keeping Arthur's royal lineage hidden.

Years later, as chaos reigned in the kingdom after Uther's death, Merlin arranged a gathering at the cathedral in London, where a sword embedded in a stone appeared, bearing the inscription that only the rightful King of Britain could draw it forth. Despite many failed attempts by knights and barons, young Arthur, attending the tournament with his foster brother Kay, pulled the sword effortlessly, revealing his true identity as king. Arthur was crowned amidst the reluctant acceptance of the nobles, and he began his reign by restoring peace and justice.

As Arthur's rule progressed, he established the Knights of the Round Table, an order dedicated to chivalry and righteousness. Among these knights was Sir Launcelot, who embarked on numerous adventures, including aiding a lady in retrieving her falcon and overcoming treacherous knights like Sir Phelot. Sir Launcelot's prowess was unmatched, and his loyalty to Arthur and the Queen was unwavering, despite the malicious rumors spread by Sir Mordred, Arthur's treacherous nephew.

In parallel tales, Sir Tristram of Liones was born under tragic circumstances, losing his mother at birth. Raised by King Meliodas, Tristram grew into a formidable knight, eventually defeating Sir Marhaus of Ireland in battle. His adventures led him to Ireland, where he met and fell in love with the Fair Isolt. Bound by duty, Tristram brought Isolt to marry his uncle, King Mark of Cornwall, but the two were bound by a love potion they unwittingly drank, leading to a tragic love triangle and eventual betrayal by King Mark.

The legend of Sir Gawain, Arthur's nephew, unfolded as he earned the title of the Ladies' Knight after a series of quests, including the pursuit of a white hart. His adventures were marked by trials of mercy and chivalry, shaping him into a renowned knight. Meanwhile, Sir Gareth, another of Arthur's nephews, proved his mettle through a series of challenges, ultimately winning the love of the Lady Liones and the respect of his peers.

The quest for the Holy Grail became a central theme, with Sir Galahad, the purest of knights, destined to achieve it. His journey, alongside Sir Bors and Sir Percivale, led to the vision of the Grail and the fulfillment of their divine quest. However, the quest also marked the beginning of the end for Arthur's fellowship, as many knights perished or were led astray.

The treachery of Queen Morgan le Fay, Arthur's half-sister, posed a constant threat. Her schemes, including the theft of Excalibur's scabbard, aimed to undermine Arthur's reign but ultimately failed. Merlin, the wise magician, foresaw the downfall of Arthur's kingdom, yet even his powers could not prevent it as he was ensnared by the enchantress Vivien.

As Arthur's reign neared its end, the treachery of Mordred culminated in a final battle in the West, where Arthur met his fate. Mortally wounded, the King was borne away to the mystical island of Avilion, leaving behind a legacy of chivalry and justice. Sir Launcelot, stricken with grief over the loss of his king and the Queen's death, withdrew to a hermitage, ending his days in prayer and penance.

Thus concluded the tales of King Arthur and his noble knights, whose deeds and legends have endured through the ages, inspiring generations with the ideals of courage, loyalty, and honor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Astonished and frightened, Master Cherry decided to give the wood to his friend Geppetto, a lively old man with a yellow wig resembling a corn pudding, who intended to make a puppet that could dance and entertain.

The Cricket warned him of the consequences of disobedience, but Pinocchio, annoyed, threw a hammer at it, accidentally killing it. Hungry and desperate, Pinocchio found an egg, only to have a chick hatch and fly away.

The setting is the planet Sargol, known for its aromatic and colorful flora, which plays a significant role in the cultural practices of the Salariki. The crew faces cultural barriers and the challenge of understanding the Salariki's customs to successfully negotiate the trade.

Key characters include Captain Jellico, the stern and experienced leader of the Solar Queen; Van Rycke, the shrewd and patient Cargo-master; Rip Shannon, the assistant Astrogator; and Ali Kamil, the Engineer-apprentice. Each character brings their own expertise to the mission, but it is Dane's actions that inadvertently complicate their situation.

During the trade negotiations, Dane learns that the Salariki have a strong affinity for catnip, a Terran plant. This discovery initially seems to offer an advantage, but it also introduces unforeseen complications. The crew's efforts are further complicated by the presence of a rival Inter-Solar (I-S) Company ship, whose crew is also vying for the lucrative Koros trade.

Tensions rise when the I-S crew challenges the Solar Queen's crew to a duel, a traditional Salariki practice. Captain Jellico represents the Free Traders and, through skill and cunning, wins the duel, securing the crew's position with the Salariki.

However, the situation takes a dire turn when members of the Solar Queen's crew, including Frank Mura and Karl Kosti, fall ill with a mysterious disease. The illness, which causes severe headaches and a comatose state, spreads among the crew, leaving only a few members, including Dane, unaffected. The crew suspects that the illness might be linked to their time on Sargol or possibly a deliberate sabotage by the I-S Company.

As the crew struggles to find a cure, they are forced to consider the possibility of being labeled a plague ship, which would result in their destruction to prevent the spread of disease. The crew's only hope lies in discovering the source of the illness and proving their innocence before they reach Terra.

In a race against time, Dane, Rip, Ali, and Weeks work tirelessly to care for their sick crewmates and search for clues. They suspect that their immunity to the disease might be linked to a ceremonial drink they consumed on Sargol, but without a clear understanding or a sample of the drink, they are at a loss.

Captain Jellico's foresight leads them to alter their course towards the asteroid belt, avoiding detection and giving them time to investigate the illness further. The crew's suspicions about the I-S Company's involvement grow, especially after hearing a warning broadcast labeling the Solar Queen as a plague ship.

The novel presents a gripping tale of survival, trade, and intrigue as the crew of the Solar Queen battles against time, disease, and corporate rivals to secure their future and prove their innocence. The story explores themes of cultural understanding, the dangers of space exploration, and the cutthroat nature of interstellar commerce.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The collection, consisting of around 2,500 pistols, is valuable and sought after by collectors and dealers. Rand's task is complicated by the fact that some of the best pistols have been stolen and replaced with junk items since Lane's death, which was officially ruled an accident but is suspected by Gladys to be murder.

The Fleming family is a dysfunctional group, with Gladys as the stepmother to Lane's daughters, Nelda and Geraldine, who despise her. Fred Dunmore, Nelda's husband, is involved in the family's business, Premix Foods, and has been handling negotiations with Arnold Rivers, a crooked arms dealer who initially offers ten thousand dollars for the collection. Rand's investigation reveals that Rivers is willing to pay up to twenty-five thousand dollars, much to the surprise of the family, indicating the collection's true value.

Rand's investigation into the stolen pistols leads him to suspect the butler, Walters, who has been cleaning the collection and has access to it. Walters eventually confesses to selling the stolen pistols to Carl Gwinnett, a commission dealer. The pistols are recovered, but Rand's suspicion that Lane Fleming's death was not an accident but murder remains.
