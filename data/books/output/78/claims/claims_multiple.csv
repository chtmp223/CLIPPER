    a. ""John Clayton and Lady Alice's son, born in their jungle cabin after their 1888 voyage from Dover"": This part is grounded in the book summary, which states that the Claytons' son was born in their jungle cabin after they were marooned on the African coast following their voyage from Dover. The chapter outline for Chapter 3 also confirms the birth of their son in the jungle cabin.
    b. ""is taken by Kala, who flees with the infant to a high tree"": This part is grounded in the Chapter 4 outline, which describes how Kala takes the Claytons' baby and flees to a high tree after Kerchak kills John Clayton.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The sequence of events is consistent with the narrative provided in the chapter outline, where the birth of the child and Kala taking the baby are directly connected.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.

   a. ""John Clayton and Lady Alice's daughter, born in their jungle cabin after their 1888 voyage from Dover"": This part is incorrect. According to the book summary and chapter outline, John Clayton and Lady Alice had a son, not a daughter. The child born in the jungle cabin is a boy, who is later known as Tarzan.
   b. ""is taken by Kala, who flees with the infant to a high tree"": This part is grounded in event 5 of Chapter 4, where Kala takes the Claytons' baby (a boy) and flees to a high tree.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid because the claim incorrectly identifies the child as a daughter, whereas the summary and outline clearly state the child is a son.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation but is based on incorrect information.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline due to the incorrect identification of the child's gender.

Since the claim contains incorrect information about the child's gender, it is not consistent with the book summary and chapter outline. Therefore, the claim is INVALID."
