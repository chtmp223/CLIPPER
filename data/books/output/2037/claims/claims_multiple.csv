Smythe/Smith's character serves as a practical illustration of the theoretical concepts the group is grappling with in their writing.","This corrupted fact misrepresents Smythe/Smith's character as consistently virtuous, which contradicts the complex dual nature described in the original outline. It also incorrectly states that this contradicts the group's debate, when in fact it would have supported their discussion about complex characters.","Chapter 9, 7","- Chapter 9, items 1-6: MacShaughnassy encounters Joseph Smythe/Joe Smith in various settings, revealing his complex dual nature.
