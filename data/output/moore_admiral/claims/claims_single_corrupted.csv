   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly grounded in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it aligns with the themes of betrayal and shifting alliances present in the narrative.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""Following Buckrow's order to work with Thirkle"": This part is grounded in event 1 of Chapter 19, where Buckrow orders Thirkle and the narrator to work together.
    b. ""the narrator loyally supports Thirkle"": There is no indication in the chapter outline that the narrator supports Thirkle. In fact, the narrator attempts to convince Petrak that Thirkle will betray him, which suggests a lack of loyalty.
    c. ""warns Petrak about Buckrow's potential betrayal"": The chapter outline does not mention the narrator warning Petrak about Buckrow's potential betrayal. Instead, the narrator tries to turn Petrak against Thirkle, not Buckrow.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the claim misrepresents the narrator's actions and intentions. The narrator does not support Thirkle or warn Petrak about Buckrow.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it contradicts the narrator's actions in the outline.

- Relationship: Temporal and spatial progression",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Thirkle, Petrak, and Trenholm travel from the jungle to the beach where the boats are hidden"": This part is grounded in event 1 of Chapter 20, where it is mentioned that Thirkle, Petrak, and Trenholm leave the jungle and head towards the beach.
   b. ""Upon arrival, Thirkle and Petrak start preparing to leave the island"": This part is grounded in event 3 of Chapter 20, where Thirkle and Petrak begin preparations to leave the island upon reaching the boats.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The sequence of events is logical: the group travels to the beach, and upon arrival, Thirkle and Petrak start preparing to leave the island.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation or assumption; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline. There is no contradicting information in the summary or outline.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Thirkle, Petrak, and Trenholm travel from the beach to the jungle where the boats are hidden"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The outline states that Thirkle, Petrak, and Trenholm leave the jungle and head towards the beach where the boats are hidden (event 1), which is the opposite direction of what the claim states.
   b. ""upon arrival, Captain Riggs starts preparing to leave the island"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The outline indicates that Captain Riggs, Trenholm, and Rajah prepare to leave the island after Rajah kills Thirkle and frees Trenholm (events 4-6).

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid because the sequence of events is incorrect. The claim suggests a sequence that contradicts the chapter outline.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it misrepresents the sequence of events.

Since both atomic parts are not grounded in the chapter outline and the relationship between them is not valid, the claim is INVALID."

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship between Trenholm's failed attempt and the beating is directly causal and meaningful, as the failure leads to the beating.
   b. The relationship between the beating and Rajah's successful attack is sequential and meaningful, as the events occur in succession and are part of the same narrative sequence.
   c. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly grounded in the chapter outline and does not contradict the book summary.
