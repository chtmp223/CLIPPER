Sally Nicholas, a young woman of charm and independence, finds herself navigating a series of personal and professional challenges upon her return to New York from a European vacation. She is immediately thrust into the complexities of her brother Fillmore's life, who has become engaged to a sensible young actress, Gladys Winch, and is entangled in the production of a new play, "The Primrose Way," which faces setbacks due to a leading lady's inadequacies and a temporary closure of theaters due to an influenza outbreak.

Sally's own romantic life is complicated by her engagement to playwright Gerald Foster, whose self-centeredness and obsession with success begin to weigh on her. Despite her love for him, Sally grapples with the realization that Gerald's ambitions may always take precedence over their relationship.

Meanwhile, Sally's influence on the lives around her is significant. Her advice to Lancelot "Ginger" Kemp, a young man from a wealthy family, encourages him to break free from his family's control and pursue his own path, though this leads to familial estrangement and financial difficulties for Ginger. Sally's sense of responsibility for Ginger leads her to use her inheritance to support her brother's theatrical ventures, hoping to secure a position for Ginger as Fillmore's right-hand man.

Sally's return to New York also brings her into contact with Bruce Carmyle, a wealthy and reserved Englishman who has followed her to America after a brief meeting in Europe. Despite his interest in her, Sally remains focused on her own life and the well-being of those she cares about.

As the story unfolds, Sally's resilience and resourcefulness are tested, but she remains a central figure in the lives of her friends and family, offering support and guidance while seeking her own happiness. Her journey is one of self-discovery, as she learns to balance her own desires with the needs of those around her, ultimately finding strength in her independence and the relationships she cherishes.
