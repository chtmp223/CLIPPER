Ingred Saxon and her family are spending their summer holidays at a farm near the seaside, marking the first time in four years that they are all reunited after the war. Ingred is enjoying the reunion but is apprehensive about the return to school. The Saxons have lent their beautiful home, Rotherwood, to the Red Cross as a hospital during the war, and now face financial difficulties, making it impossible to maintain such a large house. Instead, they plan to move into a smaller bungalow on the moors, which is disappointing for Ingred, who had hoped to return to Rotherwood.

The Saxon family, consisting of Mr. Saxon, Mrs. Saxon, and their children Egbert, Athelstane, Hereward, Quenrede, and Ingred, are all adjusting to life after the war. Mr. Saxon, an architect, struggles with the loss of his business connections, while Egbert and Athelstane face their own challenges in adapting to civilian life. Quenrede, having just left school, is searching for her identity and purpose. Ingred, a student at Grovebury College, is particularly affected by the change in circumstances, as she had always been proud of their home and social standing.

At school, Ingred is elected as the warden for her form, VA, in the newly formed School Parliament, which aims to give students a voice in school affairs. However, her pride is tested when Bess Haselford, the new girl at school, turns out to be living at Rotherwood. Ingred initially struggles with jealousy but eventually forms a friendship with Bess, realizing that Bess's family circumstances are not as enviable as they seem.

The school year is filled with activities, including the formation of the Rainbow League, a society for helping with post-war reconstruction efforts. Ingred participates in various school events, including a hockey match where she unexpectedly plays a key role in securing a victory for her team.

Throughout the term, Ingred and her friends at the hostel, including Verity, Nora, and Fil, form a close-knit group known as the "Foursome League." They support each other through school challenges and enjoy organizing events, such as a fancy-dress dance and a dramatic performance. Ingred also navigates her relationship with her music teacher, Dr. Linton, and supports Bess in playing the violin at a recital in the Abbey.

As the year progresses, Ingred learns valuable lessons about friendship, responsibility, and the importance of family. The Saxons' financial situation begins to improve when Mr. Saxon is commissioned to design a new museum and art gallery for the town, with the prospect of eventually returning to Rotherwood. Ingred's experiences at school and home help her grow in confidence and resilience, preparing her for future challenges.
