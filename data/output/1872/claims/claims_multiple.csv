    a. ""The Red House contained a single hidden passage"": The summary and chapter outlines confirm the existence of a hidden passage in the Red House, accessed through a secret door behind a shelf of sermon books in the library (Chapter 11).

    c. ""which led to a shelf of sermon books"": The secret passage is revealed behind a shelf of sermon books in the library (Chapter 11), but the claim implies a direct path from the croquet box to the sermon books, which is not supported by the outline.
