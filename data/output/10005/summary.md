The narrative follows a character named Atterley, who embarks on a remarkable journey to the moon with a learned Brahmin. Atterley starts by recounting his life on Earth, his education, marriage, and the tragic death of his wife, which leads him to seek solace in travel. During a voyage, his ship founders off the Burman coast, and he ends up in the company of a Brahmin who possesses extraordinary knowledge.

The Brahmin reveals to Atterley a secret about a metal with properties that allow for anti-gravity, which he has used to travel to the moon. Intrigued and eager for adventure, Atterley agrees to accompany the Brahmin on a lunar expedition. They prepare a copper vessel equipped with the mysterious metal and other necessary provisions for the voyage.

Their journey to the moon is fraught with challenges, including adjusting to the reduced gravity and managing their air supply. Upon arrival, they find the moon inhabited by beings similar to humans, though with distinct cultural and physical differences. The inhabitants, called Lunarians, have a society with its own unique customs, politics, and philosophies.

Atterley and the Brahmin explore the lunar city of Alamatua, observing its architecture, social structures, and the peculiar fashions of the Lunarian women, who adorn themselves to resemble birds. They encounter a variety of characters, including fortune-tellers, philosophers, and a miser obsessed with hoarding metal nails. The Brahmin and Atterley also witness a form of predatory warfare among the Lunarians, which mirrors some of Earth's historical conflicts.

Throughout their stay, Atterley learns about the Lunariansâ€™ daily lives, their long days and nights, and the celestial phenomena from the lunar perspective. The Brahmin engages in discussions about the potential origins of the moon and the similarities between lunar and terrestrial life, suggesting that the moon might have once been part of the Earth.

Their observations and experiences on the moon provide Atterley with insights into human nature, societal structures, and the folly of certain human behaviors, such as greed and war. The narrative concludes with Atterley reflecting on the journey and the profound, yet sometimes absurd, similarities between life on Earth and the moon. The story is a satirical exploration of human society, using the moon as a mirror to reflect the eccentricities and follies of humanity.
