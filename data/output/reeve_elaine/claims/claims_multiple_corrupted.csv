   b. ""first with aconite in an ice prepared by Long Sin"": This part is incorrect. The chapter outline for Chapter 2 states that Kennedy is poisoned with digitalin, not aconite. Aconite poisoning is mentioned in the context of a Tong murder case solved by Kennedy, not as a method used against him.
   c. ""later through infected mosquitoes planted on his telephone by Wu Fang and Long Sin"": This part is partially incorrect. The chapter outline for Chapter 4 mentions infected ticks, not mosquitoes, being planted on the telephone by Wu Fang and Long Sin.
