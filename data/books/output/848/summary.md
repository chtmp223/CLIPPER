In the reign of King Henry VI, the Moat House in Tunstall is a place of intrigue and conflict. Young Richard Shelton, known as Dick, is the ward of Sir Daniel Brackley, a knight with a dubious reputation. The story begins with the ringing of the Moat House bell, signaling an impending battle. Sir Daniel has been called to arms, and Dick, eager to prove himself, is caught in the tumult of shifting allegiances and the chaos of war.

As Dick is drawn into the conflict, he becomes aware of the treacherous nature of his guardian, Sir Daniel, who is accused of having a hand in the murder of Dick's father. This revelation sets Dick on a path of vengeance and justice. He encounters various characters, including Bennet Hatch, Sir Daniel's right-hand man, and Sir Oliver Oates, the priest, both of whom have their own roles in the web of deceit surrounding Sir Daniel.

Dick's journey leads him to the discovery of the Black Arrow, a group of outlaws led by Ellis Duckworth, who are sworn enemies of Sir Daniel. As Dick navigates the dangers of the forest and the political machinations of the time, he forms an unlikely alliance with a young lad named Matcham, who is later revealed to be Joanna Sedley, a girl disguised as a boy to escape a forced marriage orchestrated by Sir Daniel.

Throughout the narrative, Dick's loyalty and sense of justice are tested. He grapples with the moral complexities of revenge, the responsibilities of knighthood, and the pursuit of love. His relationship with Joanna deepens, and together they face the perils of their world, including the threat of the Lancastrian forces and the ever-present danger posed by Sir Daniel.

The story culminates in a series of battles and personal confrontations, leading to the downfall of Sir Daniel and the resolution of Dick's quest for justice. Along the way, Dick earns his knighthood and gains the respect of powerful allies, including the Duke of Gloucester. The narrative explores themes of loyalty, honor, and the struggle for power in a turbulent period of English history.

In the end, Dick and Joanna find solace in their love and the promise of a peaceful future, having survived the trials and tribulations that tested their courage and integrity. The tale of "The Black Arrow" is a classic adventure that weaves together historical events with the personal growth and redemption of its young hero, Richard Shelton.
