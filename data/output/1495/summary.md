On a bright, sunny day at the Maraposa Golf Club, Captain Gerry Poland and Harry Bartlett, two close friends and rivals, witnessed a remarkable sight—a fish-hawk diving for its prey. This event, seemingly insignificant, foreshadowed a tragedy that would soon unfold. The club was bustling with activity as it was the day of the annual cup-winners' match, a highly anticipated event with significant betting involved.

Horace Carwell, a wealthy and sporty club member, was competing in the match. Despite warnings about his tendency to overindulge in alcohol, Carwell was confident of his victory. However, after making a winning putt, he suddenly collapsed and died on the green, leaving everyone in shock.

Viola Carwell, Horace’s daughter, was devastated by her father's sudden death. Rumors began to circulate about the cause, with some suggesting heart disease or apoplexy. However, an autopsy revealed traces of an unknown poison, leading to suspicions of suicide or murder.

Viola, determined to clear her father's name, enlisted the help of Colonel Robert Lee Ashley, a retired detective known for solving complex cases. Despite his desire for a peaceful retirement spent fishing, the colonel agreed to investigate the mystery surrounding Horace Carwell's death.

As the investigation unfolded, several potential suspects emerged, including Harry Bartlett, who had quarreled with Carwell shortly before his death, and Captain Gerry Poland, who had financial dealings with the deceased. LeGrand Blossom, Carwell's chief clerk, also came under scrutiny due to his knowledge of Carwell's financial troubles and his suspicious behavior.

The investigation revealed that Carwell had borrowed a significant sum of money from Captain Poland, which had been repaid shortly before his death. However, the receipt for the repayment was missing, raising questions about Blossom’s involvement.

Meanwhile, Jean Forette, Carwell's French chauffeur, was acting suspiciously. It was discovered that Forette had a history of reckless driving and possible drug use, leading to further suspicion.

The mystery deepened when Morocco Kate, a known blackmailer, entered the scene. She had been involved in a book-selling scam with Carwell, which added another layer to the complex web of deceit.

Colonel Ashley's investigation eventually led to the arrest of Jean Forette, who was revealed to be Jean Carnot, a man with a criminal past. It was discovered that Carnot had poisoned Carwell to prevent his own exposure for theft and other crimes. The poison used was a rare and deadly substance known only to a few.

With the mystery solved, the truth was revealed: Horace Carwell was murdered, and Harry Bartlett was exonerated. Viola Carwell was relieved, and justice was served. Colonel Ashley, having fulfilled his promise to his old friend, returned to his peaceful life of fishing, content with another case successfully closed.
