Ronald West, a successful author, is preparing for a significant journey to Central Africa to gather inspiration and local color for his new novel. His wife, Helen, supports his career despite the personal cost of their impending separation. Helen is the last representative of an ancient County family and owns Hollymead Grange, where they have enjoyed a happy life together. The couple has never been apart for more than twelve hours since their marriage, making the prospect of a seven-month separation daunting. Helen is torn between her responsibilities at home and her desire to support Ronnie's work. Despite her reservations, she agrees to let him go, managing all necessary arrangements for his trip.

Ronnie's journey takes him to Leipzig, where he stays with Helen's cousin, Aubrey Treherne, a man Helen has warned Ronnie not to trust. Aubrey harbors feelings for Helen and is envious of Ronnie's success and happiness. During Ronnie's visit, Aubrey manipulates him into believing he has a past life connection with a beautiful old 'cello he purchases, which he names the "Infant of Prague." Aubrey's insinuations and manipulations lead to a violent confrontation between the two men, after which Ronnie becomes disoriented and feverish, a condition exacerbated by Aubrey's deceit.

Meanwhile, Helen is at home, awaiting Ronnie's return and unaware of the turmoil he is experiencing. She receives a letter from Aubrey, filled with malicious lies and suggestions that Ronnie is indifferent to her and their newborn son, whose birth Ronnie is unaware of due to Aubrey's interference. Aubrey urges Helen to leave Ronnie and come to him, claiming that Ronnie is unworthy of her love. Helen is shocked and devastated by the letter but resolves to respond with dignity and truth, rejecting Aubrey's advances and reaffirming her commitment to Ronnie.

As Ronnie makes his way back to England, he is accompanied by Aubrey, who plans to continue his deceit. However, Ronnie's friend, Dr. Dick Cameron, intervenes, recognizing Ronnie's deteriorating condition and ensuring he receives proper care. Dick instructs Aubrey to inform Helen of Ronnie's state, emphasizing the need for calm and avoiding any shocks that could exacerbate his condition.

Helen prepares for Ronnie's return, filled with love and anticipation, unaware of the full extent of Aubrey's betrayal. When Ronnie finally arrives home, he is initially preoccupied with his 'cello, but the sight of Helen and her tender care begins to restore his clarity and peace. Helen reveals the truth about their son, and Ronnie is overwhelmed with joy and love, realizing the depth of his wife's devotion and the new responsibilities of fatherhood.

The story concludes with Ronnie and Helen reunited, their love stronger and more profound, as they embrace their new life together with their son. Ronnie's journey, both physical and emotional, leads him to a deeper understanding of himself and his relationships, while Helen's unwavering faith and strength guide them through the challenges they face.
