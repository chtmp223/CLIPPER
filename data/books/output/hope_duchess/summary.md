The narrative begins with the protagonist, Gilbert Aycon, recounting his unexpected entanglement in a series of events following his arrival in France. He is drawn into a complex situation involving the Duke and Duchess of Saint-Maclou and a beautiful singer named Marie Delhasse. Gilbert, a man of leisure and means, is initially persuaded by his friend Gustave de Berensac to join him on a visit to Normandy, where Gustave's sister and the Duchess are residing.

Upon arrival, Gilbert finds himself in the midst of a social intrigue. The Duchess, Elsa, is in a strained marriage with the Duke, who is rumored to be infatuated with Marie Delhasse. Gilbert's presence in the Duke's household is initially under the guise of a groom, a ruse suggested by the Duchess to avoid the Duke's suspicion. This disguise leads to a series of humorous and precarious situations, especially when the Duke unexpectedly returns home.

Marie Delhasse, meanwhile, is caught in a web of manipulation by her mother and the Duke, who attempts to seduce her with the promise of the Cardinal's Necklace, a valuable family heirloom. Gilbert, upon discovering the Duke's intentions and the necklace's history, is determined to protect Marie from the Duke's advances. Marie, though initially tempted by the necklace, ultimately decides to reject the Duke's offer, a decision influenced by Gilbert's sincere concern for her well-being.

The narrative reaches its climax on the sands near Mont St. Michel, where Gilbert and the Duke are set to duel. However, their confrontation is interrupted by an attack from two thieves, Lafleur and Pierre, who seek the necklace. In the ensuing chaos, the Duke is mortally wounded, and the thieves flee. Gilbert is left to care for the dying Duke, who, in his final moments, realizes the betrayal of Marie's mother in stealing the necklace.

The story concludes with Gilbert's reflections on the events and his growing affection for Marie Delhasse. Despite the scandal and danger, he finds a sense of fulfillment in protecting and eventually winning Marie's trust. The narrative closes with Gilbert's commitment to stand by Marie, suggesting the beginning of a new chapter in both their lives.
