The narrative unfolds in a future dystopian Berlin, a city isolated from the world and entirely roofed in, where the German race has survived for centuries through a rigidly controlled society. The protagonist, a man from the World State, finds himself trapped in this city after assuming the identity of Karl Armstadt, a German chemist who perished in a mine explosion. Living as Armstadt, he navigates the complexities of this highly stratified society, where people are bred for specific roles, and knowledge is tightly controlled.

Berlin is a city of sixty levels, each dedicated to different functions, from industrial work to the residences of the elite. The protagonist learns about the social structure, including the laborers bred for physical strength, the intellectuals for their mental prowess, and the Royal House, which claims divine blood. The city survives on synthetic foods, with protium, a rare element, being essential for synthesizing protein. The protagonist, using his knowledge from the outside world, discovers a method to increase the extraction of protium, which gives him significant leverage.

Throughout his time in Berlin, the protagonist encounters various characters who reveal the city's inner workings and the oppressive nature of its social order. Dr. Ludwig Zimmern, the Chief of the Eugenic Staff, and Col. Hellar of the Information Staff, are part of a small group that secretly opposes the current regime and hopes to end Berlin's isolation by reaching out to the World State. They see the protagonist as a potential ally due to his unique knowledge and position.

The protagonist also becomes entangled with two women: Bertha, a cunning inhabitant of the Level of Free Women who deceives him with her feigned innocence, and Marguerite, a woman of noble birth relegated to the same level due to her illegitimacy. Marguerite, however, is intelligent and shares the protagonist's desire for a life beyond the confines of Berlin. Their relationship grows, but the protagonist is torn by the knowledge that Marguerite is under the protection of Dr. Zimmern, who treats her as a daughter.

The protagonist's discovery and control over the protium extraction process lead to a confrontation with Emperor Eitel I. He demands Marguerite's restoration to her rightful place in the Royal Level as a condition for revealing his secret. Although initially imprisoned, the protagonist's bluff works, and the Emperor relents, restoring Marguerite's status. This victory, however, comes with the condition that the protagonist and Marguerite must wait two years before they can marry, allowing them to integrate into Royal Society.

The story explores themes of power, control, and rebellion within a highly mechanized and socially engineered society. The protagonist's journey is one of navigating and ultimately challenging the oppressive system, with the hope of liberating the German people by reconnecting them with the world outside. The narrative ends with a sense of possibility, as the protagonist's actions set the stage for potential change and the eventual collapse of Berlin's isolation.
