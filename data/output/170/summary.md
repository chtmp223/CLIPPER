In 1860, Dr. Wybrow, a renowned London physician, encounters a mysterious foreign woman who insists on seeing him outside of consulting hours. She asks if she is in danger of going mad, sparking his professional curiosity. The woman, with a ghastly complexion and piercing black eyes, reveals that she is about to marry a man who was previously engaged to another woman. The engagement was broken off by the other woman, who wrote a noble letter of release. The mysterious woman believes she has innocently destroyed the other woman's prospects and fears a future encounter with her will bring retribution. Despite the doctorâ€™s reassurances, she remains convinced that the other woman will be her undoing.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Ferrari, a courier's wife, is desperate to find her missing husband, who was last seen in the service of Lord Montbarry. She seeks help from Agnes Lockwood, a kind-hearted woman who was once engaged to Lord Montbarry. Agnes is distressed by the news of Lord Montbarry's recent marriage to the mysterious Countess Narona and his subsequent death in Venice, under suspicious circumstances. The insurance company, wary of the large sum insured on Montbarry's life, sends a commission to investigate.

The investigation reveals that Montbarry died of bronchitis, but there are unsettling details: his courier, Ferrari, disappeared mysteriously, and an anonymous letter with a large sum of money was sent to Ferrari's wife. The Countess and her brother, Baron Rivar, are implicated in suspicious activities, including experiments in the palace's dungeons. Despite these findings, the commission concludes there is no evidence of foul play in Montbarry's death, and the insurance money is to be paid.

Agnes, deeply affected by the events, struggles with her feelings for Henry Westwick, Montbarry's brother, who has long loved her. As she tries to distance herself from the painful past, she becomes embroiled in the mystery when she receives a vision of a severed head in her hotel room, which she believes is linked to Ferrari's disappearance.

The narrative reveals that the Countess and the Baron conspired to murder Montbarry for the insurance money. They planned to replace Montbarry with Ferrari, who was to die in his place, allowing them to claim the money. However, the plot was foiled, and Ferrari was killed instead. The Countess, tormented by guilt and visions, eventually dies of a brain hemorrhage.

Henry, determined to uncover the truth, discovers that the severed head belongs to Montbarry, confirming the Countess's guilt. He decides to keep the discovery a secret, sparing Agnes further distress. In the end, Henry and Agnes find solace in each other's company, and their love offers a hopeful future, free from the shadows of the past.
