In a future where Earth, Venus, and Mars are interconnected worlds, the narrative unfolds with the assassination of key leaders sparking a crisis. The protagonist, Jac Hallen, a news-gatherer, witnesses the murder of the President of the Anglo-Saxon Republic and becomes embroiled in a conspiracy of interplanetary proportions. The orchestrator of the chaos is Tarrano, a man of immense intellect and ambition from Venus, who aims to seize control of the three worlds, leveraging the Brende secretâ€”a medical discovery promising to extend human life.

The story follows Jac, Elza Brende, daughter of the murdered Dr. Brende, and her brother Georg, as they navigate the ensuing turmoil. Tarrano, who once knew Elza, is captivated by her and takes her captive, hoping to win her affection while using her father's discovery as a tool for power. Meanwhile, Georg escapes Tarrano's grasp, returning to Earth to rally support against the looming threat.

As tensions rise, Tarrano's forces take control of Venus and Mars, while Earth struggles with internal dissent fueled by Tarrano's propaganda. The narrative shifts between different perspectives, revealing Tarrano's calculated maneuvers and the protagonists' desperate attempts to thwart his plans. The Great City of Venus becomes a battleground, with Tarrano's forces facing off against the combined might of the Venusian Central State and their Earth allies.

Despite initial setbacks, the protagonists regroup in Industriana, a city of industry on Venus, where they prepare a counterattack. The final confrontation takes place at Tarrano's stronghold, the City of Ice, where a strategic assault leads to the city's destruction. In a climactic encounter, Jac and Elza confront Tarrano, resulting in a dramatic struggle that ends with Tarrano's capture.

The resolution sees Tarrano exiled to a remote asteroid, acknowledging his defeat yet retaining his enigmatic presence. The narrative closes with Jac and Elza united, their love triumphing over the chaos, as they look toward a future of peace and recovery for the worlds they fought to save. The story explores themes of power, ambition, and the enduring strength of human connection amidst a backdrop of interplanetary conflict.
