In a small seaport town in England, Emilie Schomberg, a German governess, and her young pupil Edith Parker, embark on a journey of personal growth and understanding. Emilie, who is wise beyond her years, teaches Edith not only languages and music but also the importance of kindness and patience. Edith, a spirited twelve-year-old, struggles with her temper and the feeling of being overlooked by her family, which includes older siblings Mary, Ellinor, John, and Fred, and a mother who is often perceived as cross.

During an evening walk, Edith's stubbornness leads her to a confrontation with Joe Murray, an old sailor, who gently admonishes her for her headstrong behavior. This encounter plants the first seeds of reflection in Edith, as she begins to consider the impact of her actions on others. Emilie, ever the patient mentor, encourages Edith to see beyond her immediate frustrations and to act with kindness, even when it is difficult.

As the story unfolds, Edith learns from Emilie's example and the people around her. She witnesses the softening influence of kindness in various interactions, such as when Emilie tends to Miss Webster, their landlady, who is initially cold and unfriendly. Emilie's compassion during Miss Webster's illness leads to a change in the old woman's demeanor, illustrating the transformative power of empathy and patience.

Edith's brother Fred provides another opportunity for growth. Initially a source of irritation, Fred becomes a focal point for Edith's efforts to practice patience and kindness. Despite their frequent quarrels, Edith learns to respond with gentleness, inspired by Emilie's teachings and her own growing understanding of the "law of kindness." Fred, in turn, begins to appreciate Edith's efforts, especially after she sacrifices her beloved cat, Muff, to ensure the safety of his new canaries.

The narrative also explores the dynamics of school life, particularly through Fred's interactions with Joe White, a fellow student. Joe, who has been neglected and lacks affection, is initially hostile and difficult. However, Fred, influenced by Emilie's philosophy, decides to treat Joe with kindness despite his antagonistic behavior. This approach begins to thaw Joe's hardened exterior, demonstrating that love and patience can reach even the most unlovable hearts.

As the Parker family prepares for a summer holiday, Emilie takes on the responsibility of caring for Edith and managing the household. This period becomes a time of introspection and learning for Edith, who realizes that her previous dissatisfaction stemmed from her own faults rather than her circumstances. Her relationship with Emilie deepens, and she begins to internalize the lessons of love and forgiveness.

The story culminates in a dramatic episode where Fred and his schoolmates, including Joe White, venture into a forbidden wood. Joe, goaded by the others, climbs a tree and suffers a severe fall, resulting in a life-changing injury. This incident serves as a turning point for Fred, who reflects on the consequences of returning evil for evil. He resolves to continue practicing kindness, understanding that it is a lifelong journey.

Through these intertwined stories, the narrative emphasizes the enduring impact of kindness, the importance of empathy, and the power of love to transform relationships and heal wounds. Each character's journey is a testament to the idea that even small acts of kindness can lead to profound changes in both the giver and the receiver.
