In a remote and rugged corner of the Daleland, the story unfolds around the lives of shepherds and their dogs, focusing on the intense rivalry between two men, James Moore and Adam M'Adam, and their respective dogs, Owd Bob and Red Wull. The narrative is set against the backdrop of the harsh and unforgiving landscape, where the trials and tribulations of daily life are intertwined with the annual sheep-dog trials, a prestigious event that every shepherd aspires to win.

James Moore is the respected master of Kenmuir, a man of integrity and strength, whose life revolves around his family and his exceptional sheep-dog, Owd Bob. The gray dog is renowned for his intelligence and skill, embodying the legacy of the Gray Dogs of Kenmuir, a line of sheep-dogs celebrated throughout the region. James Moore's life is marked by his dedication to his work and his deep love for his family, including his daughter Maggie and his young son Andrew.

In stark contrast stands Adam M'Adam, a bitter and solitary figure, whose life is consumed by his animosity towards James Moore and his obsession with his own dog, Red Wull. M'Adam's relationship with his son David is fraught with tension and resentment, stemming from years of neglect and abuse. Red Wull, a fierce and formidable dog, reflects M'Adam's own combative nature, and together they form a fearsome duo, intent on claiming victory at the sheep-dog trials.

The rivalry between Owd Bob and Red Wull mirrors the animosity between their masters, reaching its climax during the annual trials. The competition is fierce, with both dogs demonstrating their prowess and intelligence. However, the trials are not merely a test of skill but a battleground for deeper personal vendettas and unresolved grievances.

Amidst the rivalry, the story delves into the personal struggles of the characters. David M'Adam, caught between his loyalty to his father and his affection for the Moore family, grapples with his identity and place in the world. Maggie Moore, taking on the responsibilities of her late mother, navigates the challenges of running the household while fostering a budding relationship with David.

As the narrative unfolds, the harsh realities of life in the Daleland are laid bare. The community is plagued by the mysterious Black Killer, a sheep-dog gone rogue, responsible for a series of brutal sheep slayings. Suspicion and fear grip the region, with many pointing fingers at Red Wull, further intensifying the existing tensions.

The story reaches its poignant conclusion with the climactic face-off between Owd Bob and Red Wull. The trials serve as the ultimate test of character and skill, with Owd Bob emerging victorious, securing the Shepherds' Trophy and cementing his legacy as the best sheep-dog in the North.
