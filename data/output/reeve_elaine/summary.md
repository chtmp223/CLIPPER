Elaine Dodge, a young heiress, finds herself embroiled in a series of dangerous and mysterious events following the disappearance of her friend, the brilliant detective Craig Kennedy. The narrative unfolds as Elaine, along with her friend Walter Jameson, navigates a world filled with treacherous enemies, including the cunning Wu Fang and his accomplice Long Sin, who are determined to retrieve a mystic ring and a powerful wireless torpedo model invented by Kennedy.

Elaine's journey begins with her escape from Wu Fang's clutches, where she is held captive. Wu Fang, a master criminal, plots to use the ring and the torpedo to further his nefarious plans. The ring, it is revealed, is the key to unlocking a hidden treasure amassed by the Clutching Hand, another criminal mastermind defeated by Kennedy.

As Elaine returns to her home, she receives cryptic warnings and faces numerous attempts on her life orchestrated by Wu Fang and his allies. These events lead her to suspect everyone around her, including the charming but enigmatic Marcius Del Mar, who presents himself as a private investigator working to thwart the foreign agents targeting Kennedy's invention.

Elaine's steadfast belief in Kennedy's survival drives her to continue seeking answers. Her faith is rewarded when she uncovers crucial clues, such as a hidden torpedo model in her belongings, which she decides to send to the government for safekeeping. However, her plans are intercepted by Del Mar and his men, who are revealed to be foreign agents themselves, intent on capturing the torpedo model for their own purposes.

Throughout the story, Elaine is aided by various mysterious figures, including a gray friar and a fussy old gentleman, who seem to be working to protect her and thwart the plans of Wu Fang and Del Mar. These figures, along with her loyal dog Rusty, play pivotal roles in uncovering plots and saving Elaine from imminent danger.

As the narrative progresses, Elaine learns of a secret submarine harbor used by Del Mar and his agents to plan attacks on America. This discovery leads to a series of thrilling confrontations, including a daring escape from a booby-trapped bridge and a climactic battle in the submarine harbor itself.

Ultimately, Elaine's determination and the help of her mysterious allies lead to the unraveling of the criminal networks threatening her and her country. The story concludes with the revelation that Kennedy, presumed dead, has been watching over Elaine all along, orchestrating events from the shadows to ensure her safety and the defeat of their enemies. His return brings closure to the harrowing events and reaffirms Elaine's unwavering faith in his survival and their shared future.
