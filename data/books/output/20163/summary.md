In a northern suburb of London, fourteen-year-old Irene Beverley is preparing for her return to school at St. Osmund's College, when her mother announces an unexpected family move to Naples, Italy. Her father has been assigned to fill a temporary position there, and the family is to relocate within a fortnight. Irene is thrilled at the prospect of leaving her disliked school and embarking on an adventure abroad.

Upon arrival in Italy, Irene is enrolled at the Villa Camellia, an Anglo-American boarding school for English-speaking girls. The school is located in the picturesque town of Fossato, near Naples, and is run by Miss Rodgers and Miss Morley. It boasts a beautiful garden and is surrounded by high walls, giving it a convent-like atmosphere. Irene quickly finds herself amidst a new world of classmates and school traditions.

The school is divided into various sororities, with Irene being initiated into the "Camellia Buds," a secret society of mutual support and fun. Her buddy, Lorna Carson, is a reserved girl with a mysterious past. Despite Lorna's initial aloofness, a bond forms between the two, with Irene's cheerful disposition gradually drawing Lorna out of her shell.

The narrative follows the girls as they navigate school life, participate in excursions, and deal with rivalries among the sororities. A major rivalry exists with the "Starry Circle," another secret society led by Bertha Ford and Mabel Hughes. The two groups compete for prominence during the school's annual carnival, a festive event where each form presents a performance. The Camellia Buds plan an animated toy-shop act, while the Starry Circle attempts to outshine them with a waxwork display.

Amidst the school activities, a subplot unfolds involving Lorna's family. Lorna's father, Mr. Carson, lives a secluded life in Naples, shunning contact with the English community due to a past accusation of embezzlement that ruined his career. During a weekend visit to Capri, Lorna learns the truth about her father's situation and vows to stand by him. A chance encounter with Mr. Beverley, Irene's father, in the Blue Grotto reveals that Mr. Carson's innocence has been proven, lifting the cloud of disgrace from his life.

The revelation brings a new beginning for Lorna and strengthens her friendship with Irene, as their families are now connected by past ties. The story concludes with a sense of hope and renewal, as the girls look forward to future adventures and the bonds of friendship and family that have been forged during their time at the Villa Camellia.
