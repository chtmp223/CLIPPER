In the magical land of Oz, a series of mysterious events unfold, starting with the disappearance of Princess Ozma, the beloved ruler of the fairyland. Dorothy, a young girl from Kansas who resides in Oz, discovers Ozma's absence. Along with her friends Betsy Bobbin and Trot, Dorothy decides to embark on a journey to find Ozma, suspecting foul play. The trio plans to visit the Munchkin Country, one of the four regions of Oz, hoping to uncover clues about Ozma's whereabouts.

The palace maid, Jellia Jamb, and Scraps, the Patchwork Girl, join Dorothy in searching the palace, but they find no trace of Ozma. The disappearance is peculiar because Ozma is a powerful fairy with no known enemies. Dorothy decides to consult the Magic Picture, a treasured artifact that reveals the location of any person in the world. However, they find that the Magic Picture has also vanished, deepening the mystery.

Meanwhile, in another part of Oz, the travelers encounter the Merry-Go-Round Mountains, a series of spinning peaks that hinder their progress. They cleverly navigate this obstacle with the help of Scraps and the Woozy, a square animal, who bravely leap across the mountains. The journey takes them to the city of Thi, inhabited by the Thists, a peculiar people with diamond-shaped heads who eat thistles due to their gold-lined insides. Despite their oddities, the Thists prove harmless, and the travelers learn more about the mysterious lands surrounding them.

As they continue their quest, they meet the Frogman and Cayke the Cookie Cook, who are also searching for a stolen itemâ€”a diamond-studded gold dishpan with magical properties. The Frogman, a learned and pompous creature, joins Dorothy's group, believing their missions are connected. Together, they venture into unknown territories, facing various magical challenges.

The Wizard of Oz, who accompanies Dorothy, discovers that his magic tools have been stolen, just like Glinda the Good's Book of Records and Ozma's Magic Picture. This theft of magical items suggests a powerful enemy at work. The adventurers suspect Ugu the Shoemaker, a magician who has been practicing dark arts and has ambitions to rule Oz.

Throughout their journey, the group encounters different characters and obstacles, including the High Coco-Lorum of Thi, who reveals that the city is protected by an illusionary wall. They also learn about the Herkus, a formidable people rumored to have giants as slaves. Despite these challenges, the travelers persist, driven by their loyalty to Ozma and the desire to restore peace to the land.

The narrative weaves through various settings, from the enchanted Yip Country to the bustling Emerald City, highlighting the diverse and magical nature of Oz. Each character, from the Cowardly Lion to Button-Bright, contributes to the quest with their unique abilities and perspectives.

Ultimately, the story emphasizes themes of friendship, courage, and the relentless pursuit of justice. As Dorothy and her companions navigate the complexities of Oz, they demonstrate the power of unity and determination in overcoming even the most daunting of magical adversaries. The adventure is a testament to the enduring spirit of the people of Oz and their unwavering commitment to protecting their beloved land and its ruler, Ozma.
