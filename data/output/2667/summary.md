The narrative begins with the Wakefield family, led by the patriarch, Dr. Charles Primrose, who is a vicar living a contented life with his wife, Deborah, and their six children. The family values simplicity and virtue, living in a comfortable home and enjoying the company of neighbors and travelers. Their children are well-formed and healthy, with the eldest son, George, destined for a learned profession, while the daughters, Olivia and Sophia, are noted for their beauty and contrasting temperaments.

The family's tranquility is disrupted by financial ruin due to the bankruptcy of a merchant holding their investments. Forced to downsize, they move to a smaller parish with hopes of maintaining their dignity and happiness. Along the way, they encounter Mr. Burchell, a seemingly poor but kind traveler who aids them during their journey.

Upon settling into their new home, the family meets their landlord, Mr. Thornhill, a charming but morally dubious young man who begins to court Olivia. Despite Dr. Primrose's reservations, the family is swayed by Thornhill's wealth and attentions. However, Thornhill's true nature is revealed when he seduces Olivia under the pretense of marriage, only to abandon her.

The family faces further misfortunes when their house burns down, and Dr. Primrose is imprisoned for debt. During his imprisonment, he endeavors to reform his fellow inmates and maintains his moral integrity despite his circumstances. Meanwhile, Mr. Burchell reappears, revealing himself to be Sir William Thornhill, Mr. Thornhill's wealthy and virtuous uncle. Sir William exposes his nephew's deceit and rescues Olivia from disgrace.

The story culminates in a series of reconciliations and redemptions. Sir William, impressed by the Primrose family's virtues, marries Sophia, while George is reunited with his beloved Arabella Wilmot, whose engagement to Mr. Thornhill is annulled. Olivia's honor is restored, and the family is relieved from their financial burdens through unexpected good fortune.

In the end, the Primrose family returns to a life of modest happiness, their trials having strengthened their bonds and underscored the value of integrity and love over wealth and social standing. The narrative concludes with Dr. Primrose reflecting on the lessons learned from their experiences, emphasizing the importance of virtue and the enduring nature of familial love.
