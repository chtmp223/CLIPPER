In a quaint town of Little Arcady, life unfolds with a blend of humor, drama, and the unexpected. The narrative is set in the late 19th century, capturing the essence of a small community where every individual's actions ripple through the social fabric. Central to the story is Colonel J. Rodney Potts, a character whose presence becomes both a comedic and dramatic catalyst for the town's events.

The tale begins with Potts, a lawyer of questionable repute, who finds himself at the heart of a local scandal. After an incident where he falls into a mill-race, Potts becomes the subject of ridicule and gossip, leading to a humorous yet biting editorial in the local newspaper, the _Little Arcady Argus_, run by the witty and somewhat sardonic Solon Denney. Solon, known for his peculiar blend of seriousness and frivolity, uses his newspaper as a platform to both inform and entertain the townsfolk, often with a touch of satire.

As the story progresses, Potts, despite his dubious reputation, decides to run for the position of County Judge, much to the amusement and horror of the town. His candidacy is a strategic move by the Democratic leaders to split the Republican vote, but it also becomes a personal crusade for Potts, who seems oblivious to the town's disdain. His campaign is bolstered by a series of letters from prominent citizens, including Asa Bundy, the local banker, and Marvin Chislett, a store owner, all of whom have been coerced or tricked into writing glowing testimonials about him.

Meanwhile, Solon Denney, who initially orchestrated Potts's departure from the town with a clever scheme involving a purse of money and letters of recommendation, finds himself in a bind. The town, once grateful for Solon's cunning plan to rid them of Potts, now turns to him again to solve the new problem of Potts's candidacy. Solon, known as the "Boss of Little Arcady," faces pressure to maintain his reputation and influence.

In a twist of fate, Solon receives a letter from Mrs. J. Rodney Potts, who announces her intention to join her husband in Little Arcady. Solon sees an opportunity in this development and, with the help of Billy Durgin, a young and enthusiastic amateur detective, he sets a plan in motion. Billy, who idolizes fictional detectives and yearns for adventure, is tasked with delivering the news of Mrs. Potts's impending arrival to the Colonel.

The revelation of Mrs. Potts's arrival sends Potts into a panic. The prospect of facing his wife, whom he had possibly left under less than honorable circumstances, is too much for him to bear. Potts hastily borrows money, purchases a bottle of whiskey, and leaves town on a freight train, effectively ending his campaign and his troublesome presence in Little Arcady.

The denouement sees Solon Denney vindicated, his reputation as the clever manipulator of town affairs restored. The townspeople, including the skeptical Westley Keyts, acknowledge Solon's deft handling of the situation, and life in Little Arcady returns to its gentle, humorous rhythm. The narrative, rich with character and local color, captures the charm and idiosyncrasies of small-town life, where every action, no matter how trivial, can have significant consequences.
