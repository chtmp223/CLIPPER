In the first chapter, we are introduced to a solemn twilight setting near Paris, where two riders, an elderly man named Seth Dingwall and a young man named Richard Barrington, are traveling with a purpose. Seth, born in Louisiana and now serving Richard, was deeply connected to the Barrington family. As they ride, they discuss the strange sights they've seen since arriving in France, suggesting that they might be useful in Paris amidst the chaos of the revolution. They find a man, Rouzet, injured by the roadside, whom they decide to help. Rouzet was carrying a message to Mademoiselle St. Clair from her lover, Lucien, who is in danger in Paris. Richard promises to deliver the message to her at the Ch√¢teau of Beauvais in Switzerland.

In the second chapter, Richard recounts their journey to Paris to the Marquis de Lafayette, who is concerned about the dangers in France. Richard has brought Mademoiselle St. Clair to Paris, and Lafayette advises her to return to Beauvais for safety. Jeanne St. Clair is determined to save Lucien Bruslart, her lover, who is not a prisoner as she thought. She learns that Lucien is considered a patriot now, which raises doubts about his honesty.

In the third chapter, Richard Barrington navigates the dangerous streets of Paris, realizing that he is a marked man. He encounters a ragged mob escorting a coach with an aristocrat prisoner and is tempted to intervene. A man named Raymond Latour, who seems to understand Richard's intentions, warns him against acting rashly. They share a drink and form a tentative friendship, with Latour hinting that he might be of help to Richard. Latour, a powerful figure among the Jacobins, later visits the Abbaye prison, where he orchestrates the escape of a woman he believes to be Jeanne St. Clair, only to discover she is another woman, Pauline Vaison.

In the fourth chapter, Richard learns from Latour that Jeanne has been arrested and taken to the Abbaye prison. Latour suspects Richard of being in league with Lucien Bruslart, but Richard denies it. Latour, believing Richard knows where Jeanne is, keeps him prisoner, hoping to extract the truth. Meanwhile, Lucien Bruslart, who has been playing a double game, is arrested and condemned.

In the fifth chapter, Richard and Seth escape from their underground prison with the help of Sabatier, who has turned traitor against Latour. Richard is determined to find Jeanne and help her escape from Paris. Jeanne, meanwhile, is hidden in a safe house set up by Latour, who is in love with her. He offers her a chance to escape with him, but she refuses, declaring her love for Richard.

In the final chapters, Richard and Jeanne are reunited, and they plan their escape from Paris. With the help of Sabatier, they travel towards the sea, hoping to find a ship to take them to America. Latour, who has sacrificed everything for Jeanne, is captured and executed, but not before ensuring Jeanne's safety. Richard and Jeanne's journey ends with them looking forward to a new life together in Virginia, free from the turmoil of revolutionary France.
