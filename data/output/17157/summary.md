The story begins with the protagonist, a man from Nottinghamshire, who narrates his life journey and the events that led him to become a traveler. After studying at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and later at Leyden, he becomes an apprentice to Mr. James Bates, a surgeon in London. His passion for travel leads him to study navigation and mathematics, preparing him for a life at sea. He serves as a surgeon on various ships, including the "Swallow" and the "Antelope," under Captain William Prichard. However, a violent storm near Van Diemen's Land leaves him shipwrecked, and he finds himself washed ashore in the land of Lilliput.

In Lilliput, he is astonished to discover that the inhabitants are tiny, not more than six inches tall. Captured and tied down by the Lilliputians, he is initially treated as a prisoner. Despite their fear of his size, the Lilliputians gradually come to trust him, especially after he demonstrates his gentleness by sparing the lives of some of their criminals. The emperor of Lilliput, impressed by his behavior, decides to grant him provisions and assigns a group of scholars to teach him their language.

As he learns more about the Lilliputians, he witnesses their peculiar customs and political affairs. The government is divided into factions based on the height of their heels, representing different political ideologies. The protagonist becomes involved in their disputes, particularly the ongoing war with Blefuscu, a neighboring island. He aids the Lilliputians by capturing the Blefuscudian fleet, earning the emperor's favor and the title of "nardac," the highest honor in Lilliput.

Despite his services, the protagonist's refusal to help the emperor subjugate Blefuscu leads to political intrigue against him. He learns of a plot to blind him as punishment for alleged treason. To escape this fate, he flees to Blefuscu, where he is received with honor. There, he discovers a boat and, with the emperor's permission, repairs it for his journey home.

The protagonist's adventures continue as he sets sail and eventually returns to England. He shares the story of his travels, highlighting the absurdities and peculiarities of the societies he encountered. His experiences in Lilliput and Blefuscu reflect on the follies of human nature and the complexities of political power, using satire to critique the politics and social norms of his own country.

The narrative is rich with themes of exploration, cultural encounters, and the satirical examination of human society, showcasing the protagonist's resilience and adaptability in the face of the unknown. Through his journey, the protagonist provides a vivid account of his interactions with the Lilliputians and Blefuscudians, offering insights into their miniature worlds and the broader implications for humanity.
