    b. Results in Barry's capture: This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. Instead, the outline describes a chaotic confrontation where Barry is not captured but rather survives the ambush, resulting in the deaths of the ambushers.
    c. Bringing the total number of deaths related to Grey Molly to two: This part is incorrect according to the chapter outline, which states that the confrontation results in the deaths of three ambushers, marking the third, fourth, and fifth deaths related to Grey Molly.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not valid because the claim incorrectly states the outcome of the ambush and the number of deaths related to Grey Molly.
    b. The relationship is not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline, as it misrepresents the events.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it contradicts the outlined events.

Since parts 1b. and 1c. are not satisfied, and the relationship between the atomic parts is not valid, the claim is INVALID."
