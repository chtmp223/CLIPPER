Chester Rand, a fifteen-year-old boy from Wyncombe, Pennsylvania, faces financial difficulties with his widowed mother after losing his job at Silas Tripp's store. Silas, a wealthy but miserly storekeeper, refuses to raise Chester's pay, leading to Chester's dismissal and replacement by Abel Wood, who works for less money. Chester struggles to find work in the small town, but his artistic talent comes to light when Herbert Conrad, an artist, recognizes his potential and sells one of Chester's sketches for ten dollars. Encouraged by this success, Chester decides to move to New York City to pursue opportunities as an artist, with Conrad's support.

In New York, Chester secures a job in a real estate office, working for Mr. Fairchild, but faces hostility from the bookkeeper, David Mullins, who wanted the position for his cousin Felix. Despite Mullins' attempts to undermine him, Chester finds success with his art, contributing to comic weeklies and securing work with Prof. Hazlitt on an ethnological book. Chester's fortunes improve, and he moves into a better room, saving money and sending some to his mother.

Chester's journey takes a turn when he meets Prof. Nugent from Oregon, who informs him of the rising value of his land in Tacoma. Chester decides to travel to Tacoma to negotiate the sale of his property, taking his friend Edward Granger with him. Edward, who fled from an abusive stepfather, learns from a family friend that his mother is being manipulated into believing Edward is dead. Chester helps Edward return to Portland, where Edward's timely arrival thwarts his stepfather's plot to claim his mother's estate.

In Tacoma, Chester successfully sells part of his land, securing a substantial sum and investing wisely in more property. Meanwhile, in Wyncombe, Silas Tripp is surprised by Chester's success and offers him a job, unaware of Chester's lucrative career as an artist. Chester's journey from a struggling store clerk to a successful artist and real estate investor highlights his determination, talent, and kindness, as he helps friends like Edward and even forgives and aids former adversaries like Mullins. Chester's story concludes with him thriving in New York, maintaining his humility and generosity despite his success.
