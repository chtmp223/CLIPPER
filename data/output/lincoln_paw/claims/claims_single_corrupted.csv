    a. Nina Potter and Leigh Wallace confessed to their involvement in Susan Baird's murder: This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. Instead, the outline states that Nina Potter and Leigh Wallace explain their actions on the night of Susan Baird's death, which suggests clearing up misunderstandings rather than confessing to involvement in the murder.
    b. Confirming suspicions about their actions on the night of her death: This part implies that their explanation confirmed suspicions, but the chapter outline does not indicate that their actions were suspicious or related to the murder. It only mentions that they explained their actions, which is not the same as confirming suspicions or confessing to involvement in the murder.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the chapter outline does not support the claim that Nina Potter and Leigh Wallace confessed to involvement in the murder or confirmed suspicions about their actions.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as there is no indication of their confession or confirmation of suspicions.

Since 1a., 1b., 2a., and 2b. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
