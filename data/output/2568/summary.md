Sigsbee Manderson, a powerful and enigmatic American financier, is found dead with a gunshot wound to the eye in the grounds of his English estate, White Gables. The circumstances surrounding his death are mysterious, with no weapon found nearby and recent marks of a struggle on his wrists. The case attracts the attention of Philip Trent, a celebrated detective and artist, who is called upon to investigate the crime.

Trent arrives at the scene and begins his investigation, navigating through a web of complex relationships and hidden motives. He learns that Manderson had been acting strangely in the weeks leading up to his death, showing signs of anxiety and paranoia. His relationship with his wife, Mabel Manderson, had become strained, with an unexplained distance growing between them. Despite this, Mabel is composed and cooperative during the investigation, though she is clearly affected by her husband's death.

Trent interviews various people connected to Manderson, including his two secretaries: Calvin Bunner, an American with a sharp business acumen, and John Marlowe, an Englishman responsible for Manderson's personal affairs. Bunner suggests that Manderson might have been targeted due to his ruthless business dealings in America, which had made him many enemies. Marlowe, on the other hand, is seen as a potential suspect due to his proximity to Manderson and his mysterious late-night errand to Southampton on the night of the murder.

Trent's investigation reveals several puzzling details: Manderson's shoes show signs of having been worn by someone else, his dental plate was left in his room despite him being fully dressed, and a large sum of money was found in his possession without explanation. These clues, combined with the absence of a weapon, lead Trent to suspect foul play rather than suicide.

As Trent delves deeper, he uncovers a complex plot involving impersonation and deception. He discovers that Marlowe had been sent on a fabricated mission to Southampton, while Manderson had orchestrated his own death to frame Marlowe. The financier's mental state, influenced by paranoia and a desire for revenge against perceived enemies, had driven him to this elaborate scheme. Manderson had staged his own murder, intending for Marlowe to be accused and executed for the crime.

Trent is faced with a moral dilemma as he pieces together the truth. He is torn between his duty to reveal the facts and his growing feelings for Mabel, who is innocent but deeply entangled in the tragedy. In the end, Trent decides to suppress his findings, opting to protect Mabel from further scandal and pain. He concludes that the truth, if revealed, would serve no justice and only cause more harm.

The case leaves Trent with a sense of disillusionment about the nature of justice and the complexities of human motives. He resolves to retire from detective work, recognizing the limitations of his own understanding and the potential consequences of exposing hidden truths. The Manderson case becomes a testament to the tangled web of human emotions and the unpredictable outcomes of even the most carefully laid plans.
