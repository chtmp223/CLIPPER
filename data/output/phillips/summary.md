Once upon a time, a lively little girl named Sally Waters lived by the sea with her loving parents. Sally was known for her bright blue eyes, her dimples, and her mischievous nature, which earned her the affectionate nickname "Saucy Sally" from her father. One summer morning, after her parents left for the city, Sally felt lonely despite the company of her yellow cat, Buff, and her brown dog, Tippy. Her spirits lifted when Tippy's antics made her laugh, and she remembered she was to spend the day with her Aunt Bee next door.

Sally and Tippy were warmly welcomed by Aunt Bee, who engaged Sally in baking a cake for a garden party. Sally helped beat eggs and butter pans, enjoying the process and the promise of a party under the black-cherry tree. Aunt Bee's garden was a place of delight for Sally, who often played there and down by the rocky shore. Across the street lived Miss Neppy Lee, an elderly lady who rented rooms to summer guests. Sally was intrigued by Miss Neppy's new guest, a little girl named Alice Burr, who quickly became Sally's friend and was invited to join the garden party.

Sally and Alice set the table with Aunt Bee's childhood dishes, and Tippy was given a bone to enjoy. The party was a success, with cake and milk served under the tree. Sally introduced Alice to her home and garden, showing her the robin's nest and the old toad's home. The day ended with Sally's parents returning from the city, bringing Sally a wooden dove that flapped its wings in the wind, a gift that delighted her.

As summer continued, Sally's adventures included a mishap with Miss Neppy's apron, which she accidentally tore while playing. Afraid to confess, Sally hid the apron but was later overcome with guilt. With her parents' support, she confessed to Miss Neppy, who was understanding and forgiving. Sally learned the importance of honesty and resolved to never keep such secrets again.

Sally's birthday brought more excitement with gifts of a tea-set, marbles, and a bathtub for her doll, Nancy Lee. The celebration included a cake decorated with chocolate mice, a surprise that delighted Sally and her friends, Alice and Andy. As the summer guests prepared to leave, Sally felt the pang of parting but was reassured by the promise of their return next year.

One rainy day, Sally and Alice played in the attic, where Tippy's mischief with Alice's doll, Tilly Maud, led to a chase and the doll's destruction. Sally's mother comforted Alice by buying her a new doll, Jack Tar, from Captain Ball's shop, known for its handcrafted dolls and ships. The girls continued their seaside adventures, including a memorable encounter with a "mermaid" who rescued Andy's toy boat.

Sally's efforts to earn money for a present for Aunt Bee by sweeping the doorstep and pulling weeds showcased her determination and thoughtfulness. Her gift of a toy duck, a soap baby, and peppermint candy was received with delight by Aunt Bee, who appreciated Sally's gesture.

The summer was filled with simple joys and lessons in kindness, honesty, and friendship. Sally's world was one of imagination and play, where each day brought new adventures and the warmth of family and friends. As the season drew to a close, Sally cherished the memories made and looked forward to the return of her friends and the continuation of her seaside adventures.
