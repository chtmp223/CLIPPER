In the late summer of 1913, Gard Kirtley, a 23-year-old American college graduate, arrived in Germany for a year-long stay, hoping to recover from personal losses and illness while immersing himself in German culture. He settled in the suburban Villa Elsa, home to the Bucher family, who were described as a typical, well-educated German household. Gard's mentor, Professor Rebner, had praised the Germans for their discipline, culture, and moral superiority, encouraging Gard to learn from them.

Gard was initially overwhelmed by the German lifestyle, which included six meals a day and an unfamiliar bed setup, but he was determined to adapt. The Buchers, consisting of Herr Bucher, a retired professor; his wife, a former singer turned housewife; their daughter Elsa; and sons Rudolph and Ernst, were welcoming but adhered to strict routines emphasizing education and discipline. Gard was impressed by the family's accomplishments, especially Elsa's talents in music and art, and he soon found himself romantically interested in her.

However, Gard's attempts to court Elsa were met with cultural barriers. German customs required chaperones for outings, and Elsa's time was consumed by her studies and domestic duties. Gard's flirtations, based on American norms, were ineffective, as German courtship was more formal and focused on marriage as a practical arrangement rather than a romantic endeavor.

As Gard navigated these cultural differences, he also encountered the Bucher family's fervent nationalism. They often discussed Germany's superiority and the possibility of war, reflecting a widespread sentiment in the country. This attitude was further exemplified by Rudolph's military aspirations and the family's reading material, which included works advocating German dominance.

Gard's experience in Germany was further complicated by the presence of Fr√§ulein Wasserhaus, a neighbor who openly pursued him, much to his discomfort. Meanwhile, Elsa's occasional moodiness hinted at a hidden personal struggle, adding mystery to her character.

Throughout his stay, Gard observed the Germans' emphasis on instruction over education, focusing on creating experts rather than well-rounded individuals. This approach, while producing competent professionals, lacked the refinement and moral development found in other cultures, leading Gard to question the true value of the German system.

As Gard's year in Germany drew to a close, he faced a dilemma: how to extricate himself from the Buchers' expectations, particularly Frau Bucher's hopes for him to marry Elsa. His decision was made easier when Elsa's long-time suitor, Friedrich von Tielitz, returned with a job offer and proposed marriage, allowing Gard to leave without causing offense.

Gard's departure from Germany was marred by a bizarre encounter with the German Secret Service, who attempted to confiscate his passport. This experience, combined with the Buchers' betrayal, solidified his disillusionment with the Germans. Despite this, Gard remained hopeful that future generations of Germans could be transformed through international education and exposure to more liberal cultures, fostering mutual understanding and reducing the risk of conflict.

In the end, Gard's journey through Germany revealed a nation on the brink of war, driven by a deep-seated belief in its own superiority. His experiences highlighted the challenges of bridging cultural divides and the importance of fostering genuine connections between nations to ensure lasting peace.
