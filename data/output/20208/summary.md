Frank Shaw, a Boy Scout from New York, is traveling with his friends Jimmie McGraw, Ned Nestor, and Jack Bosworth on the U.S. army transport _Union_ from San Francisco to the Philippines. They are under the direction of Major John Ross of the U.S. Secret Service. The boys, part of the Wolf and Black Bear Patrols, are on a mission to uncover a treasonous plot threatening the U.S. presence in the Philippines. Ned Nestor, the Patrol Leader, has previously rendered valuable services to the government in Mexico and the Canal Zone, which led to this new assignment.

Upon arriving in the Philippines, they learn from Captain Godwin, the local officer, that Lieutenant Rowe, who was supposed to brief them on the situation, has mysteriously disappeared. The hut where Rowe stayed shows signs of a struggle, and there are traces of blood, suggesting foul play. The boys, particularly Ned, suspect that Rowe and his companions have been abducted, possibly by forces conspiring against the U.S. government.

The boys discover signals in the grass, a Boy Scout method of communication, indicating that another scout, possibly from New York, is involved. They deduce that Pat Mack, a red-headed member of the Wolf Patrol who enlisted in the Philippines, might be leaving these signs. The signals guide them through the islands, where they face challenges such as a crocodile attack and the constant threat of discovery by hostile forces.

As they navigate through the jungle, they uncover a conspiracy involving native chiefs being armed for a revolt against the U.S. The boys learn that an American named French, along with other traitors, is assisting the rebels. French captures the boys and takes control of their motorboat, the _Manhattan_, intending to use it to gather native chiefs for a treaty-signing ceremony.

Ned and Jimmie, after some perilous adventures, including rescuing Pat Mack and evading capture by hostile forces, manage to retake the _Manhattan_. They learn from French, who they capture, that the treaty is locked in a box with two keys, one held by the treaty's author and the other by an American involved in the plot.

The boys face the challenge of deciphering the conspiracy's true leaders and motives, as French hints at powerful interests behind the rebellion. Despite the obstacles, the Boy Scouts are determined to thwart the plot and protect the U.S. interests in the Philippines, relying on their skills, resourcefulness, and the camaraderie that binds them together.
