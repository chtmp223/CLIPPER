While the claim accurately reflects Lady Ludlow's change in perspective on education, the specific link between Job Gregson's imprisonment and her eventual support for Mr. Gray's school project is not explicitly grounded in the provided materials. However, the broader relationship between her initial opposition and eventual support is valid.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Lady Ludlow's initial support for education for the lower classes"": This part is not grounded in the book summary or chapter outline. In fact, both the summary and the chapter outline indicate that Lady Ludlow is initially opposed to education for the lower classes. The summary mentions her opposition to Mr. Gray's efforts to establish a Sunday school, and Chapter 1 outlines her opposition to education for the lower classes.
   b. ""led to agreements with Mr. Gray over Job Gregson's imprisonment and the establishment of a Sunday school"": The chapter outline indicates that Lady Ludlow initially disagrees with Mr. Gray regarding Job Gregson's imprisonment (Chapter 2) and the establishment of a Sunday school (Chapter 4). There is no mention of any agreements being reached on these matters.
   c. ""eventually evolves into her opposition to Mr. Gray's school project"": The summary and Chapter 12 outline indicate that Lady Ludlow eventually supports Mr. Gray's school project, using part of Harry Gregson's inheritance to fund it. This contradicts the claim that her stance evolves into opposition.

   a. The relationship is not objectively valid, as the claim misrepresents Lady Ludlow's stance on education throughout the narrative.
