In 1859, Nikolai Petrovitch Kirsanov, a middle-aged Russian landowner, eagerly awaits the return of his son, Arkady, from university. Arkady arrives with his friend, Yevgeny Bazarov, a self-proclaimed Nihilist who rejects societal norms and authority. The Kirsanov estate, Marino, is a small property where Nikolai lives with his brother, Paul Petrovitch, a former army officer who is aristocratic and traditional.

The Kirsanov family history is revealed: Nikolai's father was a general, and Nikolai himself was a student in St. Petersburg until a broken leg ended his military aspirations. He married a woman named Maria, who passed away after they had a son, Arkady. Nikolai has since been managing the estate and trying to implement agricultural reforms.

Paul Petrovitch, Nikolai's brother, is a dandy who has lived a life of luxury and romantic escapades. He remains unmarried and lives with Nikolai, upholding traditional values and disapproving of Bazarov's radical ideas.

As Arkady and Bazarov settle into life at Marino, tensions arise between Bazarov's nihilistic views and the Kirsanov brothers' more conservative beliefs. Bazarov's disdain for art, literature, and romanticism contrasts sharply with the Kirsanovs' appreciation for culture and tradition.

During their stay, the young men visit a local town and meet various characters, including Sitnikov, a sycophantic follower of Bazarov, and Madame Kukshin, an emancipated woman who represents the changing roles of women in society. They also encounter Madame Odintsov, a wealthy widow who becomes an object of fascination for both Arkady and Bazarov.

Arkady falls in love with Madame Odintsov's younger sister, Katia, while Bazarov becomes infatuated with Madame Odintsov herself. However, Madame Odintsov is cool and detached, and Bazarov's feelings remain unrequited. Meanwhile, Arkady's admiration for Bazarov begins to wane as he becomes more involved with Katia.

The novel explores themes of generational conflict, the clash between traditional values and new ideologies, and the complexities of human relationships. Bazarov's radicalism challenges the established order, but his own vulnerabilities and eventual isolation reveal the limitations of his philosophy.

As the story progresses, Bazarov's visit to his parents' home highlights his internal struggles and the gap between his ideals and the reality of his life. His relationship with his parents is affectionate but strained, as they fail to understand his nihilistic beliefs.

In a dramatic turn, Bazarov contracts typhus while performing a medical procedure and ultimately dies, leaving his parents devastated. Arkady, on the other hand, marries Katia and finds fulfillment in a more conventional life, blending his father's ideals with his own experiences.

The novel concludes with a reflection on the passage of time and the enduring nature of love and family, as the characters navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing Russia.
