Phileas Fogg, a mysterious and precise English gentleman residing at No. 7 Saville Row, Burlington Gardens, is a member of the Reform Club in London. In 1872, he lives a life of routine, spending his days reading newspapers and playing whist. Fogg's life takes an unexpected turn when he dismisses his servant for a minor mistake and hires a new valet, Jean Passepartout, a Frenchman who seeks a quiet life after a series of adventurous jobs.

The story begins with Fogg making a bold wager with his fellow club members, betting £20,000 that he can travel around the world in 80 days. This challenge is sparked by a discussion about a recent bank robbery and the advancements in travel. Fogg calculates that the journey is feasible, thanks to the newly opened section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Despite skepticism from his peers, Fogg is determined to prove them wrong.

Fogg and Passepartout set off immediately, with Fogg meticulously planning every aspect of their journey. They travel from London to Suez, where they encounter Detective Fix, who mistakenly believes Fogg is the bank robber and begins to follow him. Fix's mission is to arrest Fogg once he reaches British soil, convinced that Fogg's journey is a cover for his escape.

As Fogg and Passepartout continue their journey, they face numerous challenges, including a delay in India due to an unfinished railway section. In India, they rescue Aouda, a young Parsee woman, from a forced suttee—a ritual where a widow is burned alive with her deceased husband. Fogg decides to take Aouda with them to Hong Kong, where she has relatives.

Throughout their travels, Fogg remains calm and collected, handling each obstacle with precision. Passepartout, on the other hand, is more emotional and often finds himself in tricky situations, such as when he unwittingly offends a religious group in India.

Fix continues to shadow Fogg, hoping to arrest him in Hong Kong. However, the detective's plans are thwarted when he learns that the warrant for Fogg's arrest has not yet arrived. Despite his suspicions, Fix eventually teams up with Fogg to ensure they reach their destinations on time, as Fix now hopes to arrest Fogg in England.

The journey takes them through numerous countries and across various modes of transportation, including trains, steamers, and even an elephant. Fogg's resourcefulness and willingness to spend money to overcome obstacles keep them on track, although they experience delays due to natural and man-made challenges.

As they near the end of their journey, Fogg and his companions face a final setback when they miss the steamer from New York to Liverpool by a matter of hours. Undeterred, Fogg charters a ship, the "Henrietta," and bribes the crew to take them to Liverpool. In a dramatic turn of events, Fogg takes command of the ship when the captain refuses to alter course, and they burn parts of the vessel to keep the steam engine running.

Upon reaching England, Fix finally arrests Fogg, only to realize that the real bank robber has already been caught. Fogg is released, but he believes he has lost the wager due to the delay. However, Passepartout discovers that they have gained a day by traveling eastward, and Fogg arrives at the Reform Club just in time to win the bet.

In the end, Fogg's journey around the world is not just a victory of logistics and timing but also a personal transformation. He finds love with Aouda, who proposes to him, and gains a newfound appreciation for life beyond his rigid routines. The adventure, initially driven by a wager, becomes a journey of self-discovery and fulfillment.
