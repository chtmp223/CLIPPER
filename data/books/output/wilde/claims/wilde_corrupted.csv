Upon seeing that the portrait remains unchanged, he realizes that his recent attempt at a good deed was actually motivated by vanity and hypocrisy. This sequence of events demonstrates a direct causal relationship between Dorian's decision to change and his subsequent realization about his true motivations.","Chapter 20 (Events 4, 5)","- Event 4: Dorian decides to start a new life and goes to look at the portrait in the locked room.
- Event 5: Upon seeing the unchanged portrait, Dorian realizes his good deed was driven by vanity and hypocrisy.

    a. ""Dorian's decision to start a new life"": This part is grounded in event 4 of Chapter 20, where Dorian decides to start a new life and goes to look at the portrait.
    b. ""leads him to examine his portrait"": This part is grounded in event 4 of Chapter 20, where Dorian goes to look at the portrait in the locked room.
    c. ""which reveals that his attempt at a good deed was driven by vanity and hypocrisy"": This part is grounded in event 5 of Chapter 20, where Dorian realizes his good deed was motivated by vanity and hypocrisy upon seeing the unchanged portrait.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. Dorian's decision to start a new life directly leads him to examine the portrait, which in turn reveals the truth about his motivations.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline. Dorian's realization about his motivations is consistent with his character development throughout the novel.

Since all atomic parts are grounded in the chapter outline and the relationship between them is valid and meaningful, the claim is VALID.","Dorian's decision to start a new life leads him to examine his portrait, which reveals that his attempt at a good deed was driven by fear and desperation.","- Original claim: Dorian's decision to start a new life leads him to examine his portrait, which reveals that his attempt at a good deed was driven by vanity and hypocrisy.
