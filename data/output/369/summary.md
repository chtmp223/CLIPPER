In the thirteenth century, a tale of revenge and adventure unfolds, shaking England and France. It begins with a quarrel between King Henry III and his brother-in-law, Simon de Montfort, the Earl of Leicester. Accused unjustly of treason by the King, De Montfort boldly challenges him, branding him a coward. The episode sets the stage for a series of events centered around a mysterious figure known as the Devil of Torn, later revealed to be Norman of Torn, the lost Prince Richard of England.

Norman of Torn, raised by a grim, gray old man who despises the English, grows up to become the most feared outlaw in England. Trained to be a master swordsman, he leads a band of cut-throats, preying on the rich and powerful while sparing the poor and weak. Unknown to him, his upbringing is part of a long-standing vendetta against King Henry III, orchestrated by the old man who is revealed to be Jules de Vac, a former master of fence to the English court.

As Norman of Torn grows, he becomes a pawn in the old man's game of revenge. Despite this, he develops a code of honor, protecting women and the downtrodden. His life takes a turn when he encounters Bertrade de Montfort, the daughter of Simon de Montfort. Their meeting stirs unfamiliar emotions in Norman, who is unaccustomed to love or companionship. Bertrade, unaware of his true identity, is drawn to him, and they form a bond.

The tale intertwines with the political strife of the time, as the barons, led by Simon de Montfort, rise against King Henry's misrule. Norman of Torn, though initially indifferent to the political machinations, finds himself inadvertently aiding De Montfort's cause. His involvement becomes personal when Bertrade is abducted by Peter of Colfax, a rival suitor. Norman rescues her, further deepening their connection.

Amidst battles and betrayals, Norman's true identity as Prince Richard is revealed. The Queen, recognizing the birthmark on his chest, claims him as her long-lost son. This revelation shifts the dynamics, as Norman grapples with his newfound identity and the responsibilities it entails. The narrative explores themes of identity, loyalty, and redemption, as Norman transitions from a feared outlaw to a prince with a legitimate claim to the throne.

As the story concludes, Norman of Torn, now recognized as Prince Richard, is reconciled with his royal parents. Bertrade, who has loved him regardless of his outlaw status, stands by his side. The tale ends on a note of hope and reconciliation, as Norman embraces his true heritage and the possibilities it offers for a future beyond the life of an outlaw. The complex web of relationships and the historical backdrop provide a rich tapestry for this epic tale of adventure, love, and redemption.
