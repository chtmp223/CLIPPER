Since all atomic parts are grounded in the chapter outline and the relationship between them is valid and meaningful, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""After various specialists successfully restore her beauty"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. In Chapter 18, it is mentioned that various specialists and quacks fail to restore Lady Holme's beauty, with an American specialist declaring her case hopeless. Therefore, this part contradicts the chapter outline.
   b. ""Lady Holme declines Sir Donald's offer to use Casa Felice as a hiding place"": This part is partially grounded in the chapter outline. Initially, Lady Holme declines Sir Donald's offer, but later she accepts it and arrives at Casa Felice, as mentioned in Chapter 18.
   c. ""Instead choosing to return to her active social life in London"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. There is no mention of Lady Holme choosing to return to her social life in London after the events described.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the premise that Lady Holme's beauty is restored is incorrect, and her decision to decline Sir Donald's offer is only temporary.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it contradicts the events described.

Since the atomic parts are not grounded in the chapter outline and the relationship between them is not valid, the claim is INVALID."
