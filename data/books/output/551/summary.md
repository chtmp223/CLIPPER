In the summer of 1916, an American shipbuilder and aviator finds himself in a series of extraordinary circumstances after his ship is torpedoed by a German U-boat. The protagonist, whose name is not explicitly mentioned in the initial chapters, survives the attack along with his Airedale dog, Nobs, and a young woman named Lys La Rue, who he rescues from the sea. They are eventually picked up by a tugboat, only to be captured again by the same U-boat that attacked them, commanded by Baron Friedrich von Schoenvorts.

The story unfolds as the protagonist and Lys, along with a mixed crew of Germans and allies, navigate a prehistoric world within a crater island called Caprona, or Caspak, after they are forced to take refuge there due to a lack of fuel. The island is a lost world, teeming with dinosaurs, primitive men, and other prehistoric creatures. The crew, initially divided by their nationalities and wartime allegiances, must work together to survive the myriad dangers of Caspak.

The protagonist takes command and organizes the crew into a military-like unit, establishing a fort for safety. They explore the island, encountering various tribes that represent different stages of human evolution, from ape-like creatures to more advanced humans. These tribes include the Sto-lu (hatchet-men), Band-lu (spear-men), and Kro-lu (bow-men), each more developed than the last. The tribes have a shared belief in becoming "Galus," a more advanced state of being.

The crew faces numerous challenges, including attacks from prehistoric beasts and the constant threat of betrayal from the Germans, particularly Baron von Schoenvorts. Despite this, they manage to find oil and attempt to refine it, hoping to power the U-boat and escape the island. However, von Schoenvorts betrays them, taking the U-boat and leaving the protagonist and his allies stranded.

Throughout the ordeal, the protagonist and Lys develop a deep bond, culminating in a confession of love. However, Lys is abducted by a primitive man, leading the protagonist on a desperate rescue mission. He encounters various tribes and learns more about the mysterious evolutionary processes of Caspak, which suggest a rapid progression from one form to another.

The narrative is filled with action and suspense as the protagonist battles both the natural and human elements of Caspak. Despite successfully rescuing Lys and forming alliances with some of the tribes, the protagonist ultimately finds himself alone, having lost his way back to their fort.

The story concludes with the protagonist reaching the cliffs that surround Caprona, where he writes an account of his experiences, hoping it will reach the outside world. He reflects on the improbability of rescue and the likelihood that he will remain in this prehistoric world, forever separated from civilization and the woman he loves. His final act is to cast his manuscript into the sea, a message in a bottle that may never be found.
