    a. ""Sam Marlowe explains the events of the night to Billie Bennett during their drive"": This part is grounded in event 6 of Chapter 17, where Sam proposes to Billie and explains the events of the night.
    b. ""they decide to continue to London to get married"": This part is grounded in event 7 of Chapter 17, where Billie accepts Sam's proposal, and they decide to drive to London to get married.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:

    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline. The summary indicates that Sam and Billie realize their love for each other through a series of comedic events, leading to their decision to marry despite family disapproval.
