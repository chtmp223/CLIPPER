The story begins with a scene of political unrest in a fantastical land, as people shout for "Less Bread! More Taxes!" from the marketplace. The protagonist observes this from the Warden's breakfast room, alongside the Lord Chancellor, who is perplexed by the shouting. The Chancellor, under the Sub-Warden's orders, orchestrates a march of the townspeople, who are manipulated into cheering for the Sub-Warden.

Bruno, a young fairy, enters the scene looking for his sister Sylvie. The Chancellor, surprised by Bruno's presence, directs him to where Sylvie is with the Warden. The Warden, a kind and dignified man, is seen affectionately interacting with his children, Sylvie and Bruno, who are fairies. The Warden discusses the return of a traveler, his brother, who has been away for years. The children are excited to meet him, and the Warden hints at a mysterious Professor and his inventions.

The narrative shifts to a conversation between the Warden and the Sub-Warden, where it becomes clear that the Sub-Warden and his wife, the Vice-Wardeness, are plotting to take over the Warden's position. They are scheming to manipulate the Warden's absence by controlling the kingdom and its treasury. The Warden, unaware of the full extent of their treachery, leaves the kingdom in their hands as he departs.

As the story unfolds, Sylvie and Bruno encounter various characters, including a beggar, a jester, and a gardener, in a series of whimsical and nonsensical adventures. The children possess a magical locket that allows them to navigate between the real world and Fairyland. They use it to help a beggar and to interact with the natural world around them.

The narrative intertwines with the real world where the protagonist, a man from London, is visiting friends in a country village. He witnesses the interactions between Arthur, a doctor, and Lady Muriel, the daughter of the Earl. Arthur is in love with Lady Muriel, but she is engaged to Captain Eric Lindon. The protagonist observes Arthur's struggle with his unrequited love and his decision to leave for India.

The story continues to blend the fantastical elements of Sylvie and Bruno with the real-world experiences of the protagonist and his friends. The fantastical elements are marked by whimsical characters and nonsensical events, such as a gardener singing absurd songs and a bear without a head. The narrative explores themes of love, duty, and the interplay between reality and imagination.

Throughout the tale, the protagonist reflects on the nature of life, the passage of time, and the power of dreams. The story concludes with Arthur preparing to leave for India, having resolved to move on from his love for Lady Muriel, who remains unaware of his feelings. The protagonist muses on the cycles of life, hope, and renewal as he watches the sunrise, symbolizing new beginnings for all the characters.
