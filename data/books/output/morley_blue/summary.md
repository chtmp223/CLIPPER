Gissing, a young and introspective dog, lives a comfortable, solitary life in a small house in the Canine Estates, attended only by his Japanese butler, Fuji. Despite his carefree existence, Gissing is plagued by a sense of restlessness and an inexplicable yearning for something more profound. His life is marked by simple pleasures and a strict adherence to routine, but he is haunted by mysterious whispers and an unsettling feeling of incompleteness.

One evening, Gissing hears a strange, melancholy whistle from a nearby pond, which he finds both enchanting and maddening. This recurring sound leads him to consult the local parson, Mr. Poodle, who dismisses it as frogs, but Gissing suspects a deeper significance. As spring arrives, Gissing's restlessness intensifies, and he begins to question his place in the world and the meaning of his existence.

Gissing's musings are interrupted by the sudden arrival of three orphaned puppies, whom he discovers abandoned near the pond. Despite his initial reluctance, Gissing takes them in and assumes the role of their guardian, naming them Groups, Bunks, and Yelpers. This new responsibility brings both joy and chaos to his life, as he navigates the challenges of parenthood and the demands of his growing family.

In an attempt to find purpose and direction, Gissing decides to pursue a career in the church, seeking guidance from Mr. Poodle and later from Bishop Borzoi. Although initially discouraged by Mr. Poodle, Gissing's determination leads him to an interview with the bishop, who is impressed by Gissing's sincerity and offers him a position as a lay reader at a small chapel in Dalmatian Heights.

Gissing embraces his new role with enthusiasm, though he struggles with the constraints of religious doctrine and the expectations of his congregation. His sermons, filled with unorthodox ideas and a desire for a more profound understanding of God, eventually lead to a scandal and his abrupt departure from the chapel.

Returning to the city, Gissing seeks solace and meaning in the bustling streets and towering buildings. He finds work as a floorwalker at Beagle and Company, where his charm and charisma quickly earn him a promotion to General Manager. Despite his success in the world of commerce, Gissing remains restless and unfulfilled, haunted by the same questions that have plagued him since the beginning.

Ultimately, Gissing realizes that his true calling lies not in the pursuit of wealth or status, but in the simple joys of life and the love of his adopted family. He returns to the Canine Estates, where he finds contentment in the company of the puppies and the quiet beauty of the natural world. Through his journey, Gissing learns that the answers he seeks are not to be found in distant horizons or grand ambitions, but within himself and the connections he forges with those around him.
