In a remote Ozark mountain community, a stranger named Daniel Howitt arrives, seeking solace and escape from a troubled past. As he integrates into the life of the Matthews family and their neighbors, his mysterious background gradually unfolds. Old Matt Matthews, a giant of a man, and his wife, Aunt Mollie, welcome Howitt, who becomes known as "Dad" to the community for his wisdom and kindness. The Matthews have a son, Young Matt, a physically powerful and good-hearted young man, and they are deeply connected to their neighbor, Sammy Lane, a spirited and beautiful young woman.

Sammy is engaged to Ollie Stewart, who has moved to the city to pursue education and a better life, but his letters reveal a growing distance. Meanwhile, Sammy is increasingly drawn to Young Matt, whose strength and integrity stand in stark contrast to Ollie's city-bred sophistication. As the community grapples with the challenges of a severe drought, which threatens their livelihoods, the bonds between the characters are tested.

Dad Howitt's past is revealed through interactions with the community and his own reflections. He is a former minister from the city, who fled to the mountains after his son, an artist, disgraced the family by seducing and abandoning a local girl, Maggie, who died in childbirth. The artist, presumed dead, had actually been living in secret in the mountains, where he eventually dies from a wound. Howitt, wracked with guilt and seeking redemption, finds peace in the simplicity and beauty of the Ozarks.

The narrative intertwines with local tensions, including the presence of a violent gang led by Wash Gibbs, who is a threat to the community and has a history with Jim Lane, Sammy's father. Jim's past involvement with the notorious Bald Knobbers, a vigilante group, complicates his relationship with Gibbs. As the story unfolds, Jim decides to break ties with the gang, a decision that ultimately leads to his death during a raid by law enforcement.

Sammy, who has been grappling with her feelings and future, ultimately decides to stay in the mountains with Young Matt, rejecting the allure of city life and the superficiality she perceives in Ollie's world. The community's struggles and triumphs are set against the backdrop of the timeless, majestic hills, which serve as a source of strength and refuge for the characters.

The story concludes with a sense of renewal and hope, as Young Matt and Sammy embrace their future together, rooted in the land and the values that have shaped them. Dad Howitt, having found a measure of peace and redemption, continues to live in the mountains, a shepherd in both the literal and spiritual sense, guiding the community with his wisdom. The tale is a poignant exploration of love, redemption, and the enduring power of nature to heal and transform.
