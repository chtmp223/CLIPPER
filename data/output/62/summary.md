The narrative begins with John Carter, a former Confederate officer, who mysteriously finds himself on Mars, a planet with starkly different conditions from Earth. He discovers that he possesses extraordinary strength and agility due to the lower gravity and thinner atmosphere. As he navigates this alien world, he encounters the green Martians, a warlike and nomadic race characterized by their tall stature, multiple limbs, and lack of familial bonds.

Carter is captured by a group of these green Martians, led by Tars Tarkas, a warrior of significant stature and ability. Despite their initial hostility, Carter's physical prowess and bravery earn him a degree of respect among the Martians. He befriends Sola, a female Martian who shows him kindness and helps him learn the Martian language and customs. Sola is an anomaly among her people, displaying emotions and empathy uncommon to her kind.

During his captivity, Carter witnesses the harshness of Martian society, where survival of the fittest is the law and the weak are mercilessly culled. The green Martians live in ancient, deserted cities and have a complex social structure based on strength and combat prowess. Carter learns that the green Martians reproduce by laying eggs, which are incubated for five years before hatching.

Carter's life takes a dramatic turn when he encounters Dejah Thoris, a beautiful red Martian princess from the city of Helium, who has been captured by the green Martians. Unlike the green Martians, the red Martians are more human-like in appearance and possess advanced technology. Dejah Thoris is intelligent, courageous, and embodies the virtues of her people. Carter is immediately captivated by her and vows to protect her.

As Carter and Dejah Thoris interact, a mutual affection develops, complicated by the Martian customs and the political tensions between their peoples. Dejah Thoris is promised to Sab Than, the prince of the rival city Zodanga, in a political marriage that would prevent war between their cities. However, she despises Sab Than and is drawn to Carter, who offers her the promise of freedom and love.

Carter's loyalty and bravery win him allies among the green Martians, including Tars Tarkas, who harbors a secret compassion due to his own personal losses. Together, they plan a daring escape to return Dejah Thoris to her people and thwart the ambitions of Sab Than. Their journey is fraught with danger as they navigate the treacherous Martian landscape and face the relentless pursuit of their enemies.

The climax of the story occurs when Carter leads an alliance of green Martians and Heliumite forces to overthrow the tyrannical rule of Zodanga and prevent Dejah Thoris's forced marriage. In a grand battle, Carter's strategic acumen and combat skills turn the tide in favor of the Heliumites, and Sab Than is defeated.

With peace restored and Zodanga subdued, Carter is hailed as a hero. His relationship with Dejah Thoris deepens, and they pledge their love for each other. However, just as Carter is about to find happiness, he is mysteriously transported back to Earth, leaving him longing to return to Mars and the woman he loves.

The story concludes with Carter reflecting on his adventures and the impact they have had on his life. Despite his return to Earth, he remains hopeful that he will one day be reunited with Dejah Thoris and continue his life on the red planet.
