However, the outline does not explicitly mention the scabbard being obtained at the same time as the sword. The book summary does mention Morgan le Fay's theft of Excalibur's scabbard, implying its existence, but not its acquisition alongside the sword.
   b. ""is later thrown into a mere by Morgan le Fay, where it sinks and disappears forever"": This part is grounded in Chapter 5, event 6, where Morgan le Fay throws the scabbard into the waters of a mere, where it sinks and disappears forever.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is meaningful and valid, as it describes a sequence of events involving the scabbard of Excalibur being obtained and later lost.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is based on the events described in the chapter outline.

"While Arthur proves his right to kingship by pulling a sword from a stone, Sir Galahad later proves himself as the best knight by removing a sword from a mysterious stone that appears in the river at Camelot.","While Arthur proves his right to kingship by pulling a sword from a lake, Sir Galahad later proves himself as the best knight by removing a sword from a mysterious stone that appears in the river at Camelot.","This fact draws a parallel between two significant sword-pulling events in the story. In Chapter 1, Arthur unknowingly pulls the sword from the stone, proving his right to kingship. Later, in Chapter 23, a similar event occurs when Sir Galahad removes the sword from a mysterious stone in the river, proving himself as the best knight. This parallel highlights the symbolic significance of these acts in determining leadership and worth.","The corrupted fact incorrectly states that Arthur pulled the sword from a lake, when the chapter outline clearly states it was from a stone.","Chapter 1, 23","- Chapter 23, item 2: At Camelot, a mysterious stone with a sword appears in the river, which only the best knight can remove.

- Relationship: Parallel events, symbolic significance",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""Arthur proves his right to kingship by pulling a sword from a stone"": This part is grounded in the book summary, where Arthur pulls the sword from the stone, revealing his identity as the rightful king. It is also supported by Chapter 1, events 4 and 6.
    b. ""Sir Galahad later proves himself as the best knight by removing a sword from a mysterious stone that appears in the river at Camelot"": This part is grounded in Chapter 23, events 2 and 4, where Sir Galahad removes a sword from a stone in the river, indicating his status as the best knight.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is meaningful and valid, as both Arthur and Galahad prove their worth through similar acts of pulling swords from stones, which are significant events in their respective narratives.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly supported by the chapter outline and the book summary.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as both events are pivotal in establishing the characters' roles and statuses.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Arthur proves his right to kingship by pulling a sword from a lake"": This part is incorrect. According to both the book summary and Chapter 1 outline, Arthur proves his right to kingship by pulling a sword from a stone, not a lake. The sword in the stone is a central element in Arthur's ascension to the throne.
   b. ""Sir Galahad later proves himself as the best knight by removing a sword from a mysterious stone that appears in the river at Camelot"": This part is grounded in Chapter 23, where Sir Galahad removes a sword from a stone in the river, proving himself as the best knight.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is intended to draw a parallel between Arthur and Galahad's actions, suggesting both prove their worth through similar feats involving swords and stones. However, the claim inaccurately describes Arthur's feat, which undermines the validity of the relationship.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation but is based on the events described. However, due to the inaccuracy in the first atomic part, the relationship is not meaningful or valid.
   c. The relationship does not contradict the summary or outline regarding Galahad's actions, but it does misrepresent Arthur's actions.

Since the first atomic part is not grounded in the events and the relationship is based on this incorrect information, the claim is INVALID."
