Jeff Rand, a private detective and arms expert, is hired by Gladys Fleming to appraise and sell her late husband Lane Fleming's extensive pistol collection. The collection, consisting of around 2,500 pistols, is valuable and sought after by collectors and dealers. Rand's task is complicated by the fact that some of the best pistols have been stolen and replaced with junk items since Lane's death, which was officially ruled an accident but is suspected by Gladys to be murder.

The Fleming family is a dysfunctional group, with Gladys as the stepmother to Lane's daughters, Nelda and Geraldine, who despise her. Fred Dunmore, Nelda's husband, is involved in the family's business, Premix Foods, and has been handling negotiations with Arnold Rivers, a crooked arms dealer who initially offers ten thousand dollars for the collection. Rand's investigation reveals that Rivers is willing to pay up to twenty-five thousand dollars, much to the surprise of the family, indicating the collection's true value.

Rand's investigation into the stolen pistols leads him to suspect the butler, Walters, who has been cleaning the collection and has access to it. Walters eventually confesses to selling the stolen pistols to Carl Gwinnett, a commission dealer. The pistols are recovered, but Rand's suspicion that Lane Fleming's death was not an accident but murder remains.

Rand's investigation is further complicated by the involvement of the State Police and the District Attorney, who initially suspect Stephen Gresham, a friend of the Flemings and a potential buyer of the collection, of the murder of Arnold Rivers, who was found dead in his shop. Rand clears Gresham of suspicion and continues to investigate the possibility that Lane Fleming was murdered to facilitate a merger between Premix Foods and National Milling & Packaging, which Lane opposed.

Rand's investigation uncovers that Fred Dunmore had a contract with National Milling & Packaging, promising him a vice-presidency if the merger went through. This contract, coupled with Rivers' blackmail attempt over the fraudulent pistols he sold Lane, provides a motive for both murders. Dunmore's plan was to eliminate Rivers and pin the blame on Rand and Anton Varcek, another family member, by staging an encounter where Rand would be forced to kill Varcek in self-defense.

The plan is thwarted when Rand, with the help of his assistant Dave Ritter, confronts Dunmore in the Fleming gunroom. Dunmore attempts to kill Rand with a silenced pistol, but Rand, wearing a bulletproof vest, survives the attack. Ritter shoots and kills Dunmore, preventing the murder from being pinned on Rand and Varcek.

In the aftermath, Rand successfully sells the collection to Gresham and his associates, ensuring that the pistols do not fall into the hands of the unscrupulous Rivers. Rand's investigation not only uncovers the truth behind Lane Fleming's death but also prevents further manipulation of the Premix Foods merger, protecting the interests of the family and the company.
