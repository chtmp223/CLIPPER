   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The claim describes a scene where Betty is waiting, and Tom approaches her to say goodbye, which is consistent with the events outlined in Chapter 20.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation or assumption; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.

    a. ""Betty Carewe paces nervously by the sun-dial among rose bushes at noon"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The outline states that Betty stands motionless by the sun-dial among lilac bushes at twilight, not pacing among rose bushes at noon.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not meaningful or valid because the actions described do not align with the events in the chapter outline. The claim suggests a different time of day and different actions than those described in the outline.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it contradicts the details provided.
