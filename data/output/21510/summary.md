In a galaxy teeming with intrigue and advanced technology, Trigger Argee finds herself at the center of a mystery involving ancient alien plasmoids, powerful entities capable of immense creation and destruction. The story unfolds on the University World of Maccadon, where Trigger, a skilled and resourceful young woman, is drawn into a complex web of political and scientific machinations.

Trigger's journey begins with her involvement in the Plasmoid Project, a high-security research initiative aimed at understanding the enigmatic plasmoids left behind by the Old Galactics. These ancient beings have long vanished, but their creations remain, sparking a race among various factions to unlock their secrets. Trigger's unique connection to one particular plasmoid, 113-A, becomes a focal point of the story. This connection, initially mysterious, evolves into a deeper bond as Trigger discovers that the plasmoid is attempting to communicate with her, revealing glimpses of its vast knowledge.

Commissioner Holati Tate, a seasoned and cunning operative, guides Trigger through the labyrinth of intrigue. Together, they uncover the sinister motives of various groups, including the Devagas, a secretive and aggressive faction with its own designs on the plasmoids. The Devagas, led by the ruthless Balmordan, have captured a key plasmoid, 112-113, which they hope to use for their own ends. However, the plasmoid's potential for mind control and creation poses a significant threat, not only to the Devagas but to the entire galaxy.

As Trigger navigates this dangerous landscape, she encounters allies and adversaries, including the enigmatic Lyad Ermetyne of Tranest, a powerful figure with her own agenda. Lyad's initial attempts to manipulate Trigger evolve into a grudging respect as they face common enemies. Meanwhile, Major Heslet Quillan, a dashing and capable Space Scout, becomes both a protector and a romantic interest for Trigger, adding layers of personal stakes to the unfolding drama.

The story reaches its climax as Trigger, armed with the knowledge imparted by the plasmoid, leads a daring mission to prevent the Devagas from unleashing the full power of the king plasmoid. In a tense confrontation, Trigger's quick thinking and bravery are put to the test as she navigates the perilous environment of the plasmoid station, battling both the Devagas and the plasmoids themselves.

Ultimately, Trigger's unique bond with the plasmoid allows her to avert disaster, securing the future of the galaxy. The resolution brings a new understanding of the plasmoids' origins and their creators, the Old Galactics, hinting at a vast and ancient history that continues to influence the present.

In the aftermath, Trigger reflects on her experiences, finding a new sense of purpose and direction. Her relationship with Quillan deepens, promising a future filled with adventure and discovery. The story concludes with Trigger poised to explore new horizons, armed with the knowledge and skills gained from her extraordinary journey.
