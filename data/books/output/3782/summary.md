In the early chapters of the story, we meet Mr. Dickson McCunn, a retired provision merchant from Glasgow, who is experiencing the liberating effects of his newfound leisure. Inspired by a sense of adventure and the arrival of spring, he decides to take a walking holiday in the Scottish countryside. His journey leads him to the village of Dalquharter, where he encounters a mysterious and unsettling atmosphere surrounding the nearby Huntingtower House.

Dickson's curiosity is piqued by the strange behavior of the locals and the presence of foreigners in the area. He encounters Mr. John Heritage, a poet and fellow traveler, who shares his interest in the peculiar happenings around Huntingtower. Together, they learn that the house is not as abandoned as it seems; it harbors two women in distress—Saskia, a young Russian princess, and her elderly cousin Eugènie.

Saskia reveals to Dickson and Heritage that she is on the run from Bolshevik agents who are after a cache of valuable jewels she is safeguarding. She awaits the arrival of a trusted friend, Alexis, who has yet to appear. Meanwhile, the house is under surveillance by a group of men led by Dobson, the innkeeper, and his associates, Lean and Spittal, who are part of a larger conspiracy to capture Saskia and the jewels.

Dickson and Heritage, along with the help of Dougal, the leader of a group of local boys known as the Gorbals Die-Hards, decide to protect Saskia and thwart the plans of her pursuers. They face numerous challenges, including the threat of violence from the conspirators and the need to keep the jewels safe. Dickson, initially reluctant to involve himself in such dangerous affairs, finds his courage and determination growing as he becomes more deeply involved in the unfolding drama.

As tensions rise, Dickson devises a plan to transport the jewels safely to Glasgow, where they can be deposited in a bank for protection. Despite the risks, he successfully completes this mission, outsmarting Dobson and his men in the process. However, the threat to Saskia remains, as the conspirators are determined to capture her before the arrival of the mysterious Alexis.

The story reaches its climax with a series of daring maneuvers and strategic planning by Dickson, Heritage, Dougal, and the Die-Hards. They prepare to defend Huntingtower House from an impending attack, hoping to hold out until help arrives. As the night unfolds, the group must rely on their wits, bravery, and the strength of their unlikely alliance to protect Saskia and ensure her safety.

Throughout the narrative, themes of courage, loyalty, and the unexpected heroism of ordinary people are explored. Dickson McCunn, initially an unlikely hero, rises to the occasion, driven by a sense of duty and the desire to protect those in need. The story combines elements of adventure, mystery, and a touch of romance, set against the backdrop of the Scottish countryside.
