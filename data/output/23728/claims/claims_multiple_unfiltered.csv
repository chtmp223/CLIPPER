   a. The relationship between Walter discovering the tracks and reporting them to Mr. Crowninshield is valid and sequential, as it follows the logical progression of events in Chapter 8.
   b. The relationship between Mr. Crowninshield informing Walter about Bob's involvement and the previous events is also valid, as it follows the narrative progression from Chapter 8 to Chapter 9.

   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly supported by the events in the summary and chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as Mr. Crowninshield's promise is a reward for the boys' efforts in resolving the Lola case, which indirectly addresses Mrs. King's financial concerns.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Mrs. King's financial troubles, including investment issues and mortgage concerns"": This part is grounded in event 2 of Chapter 1, where Mrs. King reveals financial troubles to Walter.
   b. ""are ultimately addressed by Walter getting a high-paying job at Surfside"": This part is not explicitly grounded in the summary or chapter outline. While Walter does accept a job at Surfside (event 3 of Chapter 1), there is no indication that this job is high-paying or that it ultimately resolves the financial troubles.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid. The claim suggests a causal relationship between Walter's job and the resolution of financial troubles, but this is not supported by the summary or outline. The summary mentions that Mr. Crowninshield offers to support Mrs. King's financial security at the end of the story, but this is not directly linked to Walter's job at Surfside.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly stated in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not contradict any information in the summary or outline, but it lacks explicit support.

Since 1b. and 2a. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
