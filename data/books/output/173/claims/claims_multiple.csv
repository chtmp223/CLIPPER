- Relationship: The strange red mark, the cry, and the ""Zayat Kiss"" are all related to Sir Crichton's death and Fu-Manchu's methods.",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""The strange red mark on Sir Crichton's hand"": This part is grounded in event 6 of Chapter 1, where Smith and Petrie examine Sir Crichton's body and note a strange red mark on his hand.
   b. ""The cry heard at the time of his death"": This part is grounded in event 2 of Chapter 2, where Wills, a groom, mentions a strange cry heard at the time of Sir Crichton's death.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The claim suggests a connection between the red mark, the cry, and Fu-Manchu's method, which is plausible given the context of Fu-Manchu's unconventional and deadly methods.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation or assumption. The narrative implies that Fu-Manchu's methods are mysterious and lethal, which could logically connect the red mark and the cry to the ""Zayat Kiss.""
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline. The summary describes Fu-Manchu as employing deadly methods, and the chapter outlines provide details that could be linked to such methods.

   c. ""related to Fu-Manchu's method known as the 'Zayat Kiss'"": In Chapter 3, event 2, Smith explains the ""Zayat Kiss"" and his theory about Fu-Manchu's methods to Petrie. However, there is no explicit connection made between the ""Zayat Kiss"" and the specific events of the mark or the cry in the chapter outline.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the chapter outline does not explicitly connect the mark or the cry to the ""Zayat Kiss."" The claim assumes a connection that is not directly supported by the provided information.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation, as it infers a connection between the events and Fu-Manchu's method without explicit evidence in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not contradict the summary or outline, but it lacks explicit support.

Since the claim relies on an assumption not explicitly supported by the chapter outline or summary, and there is a discrepancy regarding the color of the mark, the claim is INVALID."
