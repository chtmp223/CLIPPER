The story revolves around the younger generation of the Rover family, focusing on the adventures of Jack, Fred, Andy, and Randy Rover at Colby Hall Military Academy. The tale begins with the four boys being introduced as mischievous yet good-hearted lads, much like their fathers—Dick, Tom, and Sam Rover—who were known for their adventurous spirits in their own youth.

The setting transitions to Colby Hall, a military school run by Colonel Lawrence Colby, an old friend of the boys' fathers. The Rovers are excited about their new school life, eager to make friends and engage in various activities, including football and military drills. They quickly become acquainted with fellow cadets such as Spouter Powell, Gif Garrison, and others, and also meet some adversaries like Nappy Martell and Slugger Brown, who cause trouble throughout the story.

Early on, the boys encounter Nappy Martell, a bully with a grudge against the Rovers, stemming from an incident involving a street peddler in New York. This animosity leads to several conflicts, including a physical altercation between Jack and Nappy. Despite these challenges, the Rovers make new friends, including the girls from Clearwater Hall, a nearby school, leading to budding friendships and potential romances.

The narrative includes several exciting episodes, such as the boys' participation in football games against rival schools, where Jack and Fred shine on the field, contributing to Colby Hall's victories. The story also delves into the boys' interactions with their professors, particularly the stern and disliked Professor Asa Lemm, who becomes the target of some of their pranks.

A significant subplot involves a false accusation against Jack and Fred, who are wrongfully blamed for shooting two cows belonging to a local farmer, Elias Lacy. The boys are temporarily held in the school's guardroom until their innocence is proven. It is revealed that Nappy Martell and Slugger Brown were behind the incident, trying to frame the Rovers. This revelation, along with evidence of their involvement in other misdeeds, leads to Nappy and Slugger's withdrawal from the school.

The story culminates in a thrilling football match between Colby Hall and Columbus Academy, where the Rovers, particularly Jack and Fred, play pivotal roles in securing a victory for their team. The win is celebrated with great enthusiasm, highlighting the camaraderie and spirit of the cadets at Colby Hall.

Throughout the narrative, themes of friendship, loyalty, and justice are prevalent, showcasing the Rovers' growth and resilience in the face of adversity. The story ends on a high note, with the boys looking forward to more adventures and the continuation of their education at Colby Hall.
