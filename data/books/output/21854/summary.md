The story revolves around the mysterious death of Sigsbee Manderson, a wealthy and influential businessman with a complex past. Manderson was known for his ruthless business practices and had a history of creating enemies, particularly in the financial world. Despite his wealth and power, his personal life was marked by a lack of close relationships, including a strained marriage with his wife, Mabel Manderson.

The narrative begins with the discovery of Manderson's body, which sets off a series of events involving various characters connected to him. Among them is Philip Trent, a talented artist and amateur detective, who is sent by a newspaper to investigate the case. Trent is known for his keen observation skills and has previously solved complex mysteries.

As Trent delves into the investigation, he encounters several key figures, including Calvin Bunner, Manderson's American secretary, and John Marlowe, his English secretary. Marlowe, in particular, becomes a central figure in the investigation due to his close association with Manderson and his peculiar behavior following the murder.

Trent's investigation reveals numerous oddities surrounding Manderson's death. These include the absence of a struggle, the lack of a weapon at the scene, and the discovery of Manderson's dental plate left behind, which seems out of character for someone so meticulous. Additionally, the circumstances of Manderson's last evening alive, including a supposed moonlight drive with Marlowe, raise further suspicions.

As Trent pieces together the evidence, he uncovers a complex web of deception and hidden motives. He learns that Manderson had been acting strangely in the weeks leading up to his death, possibly due to a secret anxiety or threat. This leads Trent to suspect that Manderson's death was not a simple murder but part of a larger, more intricate plot.

The investigation takes a dramatic turn when Trent discovers that Marlowe had impersonated Manderson on the night of the murder, creating an alibi for himself. This revelation leads Trent to question Marlowe's involvement in the crime and his possible motives, which may include a romantic interest in Mabel Manderson.

However, as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Manderson's death was a result of his own elaborate scheme to frame Marlowe for murder. Manderson's deep-seated jealousy and paranoia drove him to orchestrate his own death in a way that would implicate Marlowe, whom he irrationally believed was involved with his wife.

In the end, Trent's investigation reveals the truth, clearing Marlowe of suspicion and exposing Manderson's tragic and self-destructive plan. The story concludes with Trent reflecting on the complexities of human nature and the challenges of uncovering the truth in a world filled with deception and hidden agendas.
