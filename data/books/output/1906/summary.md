In the novel's opening chapter, we are introduced to a shearing season at a sheep station, where the protagonist encounters Chowbok, an old native chief with a reputation for mischief when drunk. The protagonist, intrigued by local legends of unexplored ranges, attempts to extract information from Chowbok by bribing him with alcohol. Chowbok, however, feigns intoxication and offers little useful information. Determined to uncover the mystery of the ranges, the protagonist plans an exploration trip, enlisting Chowbok's reluctant assistance.

The protagonist sets out on his journey, navigating through challenging terrain and encountering various obstacles. As they progress, Chowbok becomes increasingly uneasy, eventually abandoning the protagonist. Undeterred, the protagonist continues alone, driven by curiosity and a desire for discovery. He eventually reaches a remote and mysterious land, where he discovers a civilization with peculiar customs and beliefs.

In this new world, illness is treated as a crime, and misfortune is considered a moral failing. The protagonist learns that the society is governed by a unique set of laws and customs, where physical ailments are punished, and moral transgressions are treated with understanding and rehabilitation. This society's legal and moral systems are inverted compared to those of the protagonist's own world.

As the protagonist navigates this strange society, he encounters various characters, including the Nosnibor family, who provide him with insights into the Erewhonian way of life. He learns about their educational system, which emphasizes the study of hypotheticals and unreason, and their religious practices, which are centered around the worship of personified human qualities.

Throughout his journey, the protagonist grapples with the cultural differences and philosophical challenges presented by the Erewhonians. He becomes involved with Arowhena, a beautiful young woman, and together they plan an escape from Erewhon. They devise a daring plan to leave the country using a balloon, which they construct with the help of the Queen's workmen.

The escape is fraught with danger, but the protagonist and Arowhena manage to ascend in the balloon and navigate through a perilous journey, eventually being rescued by an Italian ship. They return to England, where the protagonist reflects on his experiences and contemplates the implications of the Erewhonian society.

The novel concludes with the protagonist's plan to introduce the Erewhonians to the outside world through a missionary expedition, revealing his complex feelings about the society he encountered and the potential for cultural exchange and transformation.
