In a time long past, a community known as the Markmen lived beside a great wood, with their settlement called Mid-mark. This society was composed of various kinships or Houses, each marked by distinct banners and totems. The Wolfings, one of the prominent Houses, bore a Wolf on their banner and were known for their expertise in iron-founding, which equipped them with tools and weapons for both craft and war.

The narrative begins with the Wolfings preparing for an impending conflict, as their scouts report the movements of a Roman host threatening their lands. The Hall-Sun, a young seeress of the Wolfing House, foresees the danger and urges the warriors to prepare. The Wolfings, along with their allies, gather to discuss strategy and choose their War-duke. Thiodolf, a revered and mighty warrior of the Wolfings, is chosen alongside Otter of the Laxings, as they prepare to defend their territory against the Romans.

The story unfolds with the Markmen organizing their forces and setting out to meet the Roman threat. They gather at a sacred Thing-stead, a traditional meeting place, where they perform rituals and sacrifices to seek the favor of the Gods. As they march to battle, various characters, including Thiodolf and the Hall-Sun, are introduced, each playing a crucial role in the unfolding events.

Thiodolf, clad in a dwarf-wrought hauberk, leads the charge against the Romans, showcasing his valor and strategic acumen. However, he is haunted by a foreboding sense of doom, exacerbated by the Hall-Sun's visions of fire and destruction. The narrative is rich with descriptions of the landscape, the customs of the Markmen, and the tension between the impending battle and the everyday life of the community.

As the Markmen engage the Romans, the story delves into the personal struggles and heroic deeds of Thiodolf and his companions. The Hall-Sun's visions and the advice of the Wood-Sun, a mystical figure, weigh heavily on Thiodolf's mind as he grapples with his fate. The battle scenes are vivid, highlighting the bravery and camaraderie of the Markmen as they fight to protect their homes.

The tale culminates with the Markmen's efforts to defend their land and the sacrifices made by their leaders. Thiodolf's journey is one of honor and duty, as he faces the ultimate test of leadership and courage. The narrative weaves together themes of loyalty, prophecy, and the struggle between tradition and change, set against the backdrop of a mythical past.

In the end, the Markmen's fate hangs in the balance as they confront the might of the Roman Empire, with the Hall-Sun's prophecies guiding their path. The story closes with a sense of continuity and resilience, as the community prepares to rebuild and carry forward the legacy of their forebears.
