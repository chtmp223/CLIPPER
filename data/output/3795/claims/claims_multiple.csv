   a. The relationship between the atomic parts is not valid because the claim incorrectly identifies Thorny as Miss Celia's father, which is a factual error.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation but is based on incorrect information.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline due to the factual inaccuracy regarding Thorny's identity.

Since part 1c is not grounded in the chapter outline and the relationship between the atomic parts is based on incorrect information, the claim is INVALID."
