In the opening chapter, we meet the narrator, a deeply troubled man who is desperately searching for his missing sister, Margaret. She vanished two months ago after a seemingly innocuous trip to New York with Mrs. Furneau, a family acquaintance. The narrator describes the emotional turmoil and relentless pursuit that have consumed him since her disappearance. Despite exhaustive efforts involving the police, detective agencies, and various social organizations, he has found no trace of Margaret. His quest has led him through the underbelly of the city, exposing him to its darker elements, but still, he remains without answers.

The narrative takes a turn when the narrator encounters Larry, a charming and resourceful Irishman who becomes his unexpected ally. Larry's introduction is dramatic; he jumps into the narrator's car on the run from gangsters, pleading for help. Despite the odd circumstances, the narrator is drawn to Larry's vivacity and intelligence, and they quickly form a bond. Larry's knowledge of the city's underworld becomes an asset in the narrator's search, and together they navigate the complexities of the urban landscape.

As the narrator reflects on his past, we learn more about the day Margaret disappeared. She had been excited to attend a luncheon and a matinee in New York, a special treat she had eagerly anticipated. The last person to see her was Mrs. Furneau, who allowed Margaret to go shopping alone, only for her never to return. The narrator's frustration is palpable as he recounts the fruitless search efforts and the growing despair that has settled over him.

The chapter closes with the narrator's renewed resolve to dedicate his life to finding Margaret, no matter the cost. This resolve is bolstered by Larry's unexpected arrival and the hope that, with Larry's help, he might finally uncover the truth. Together, they stand on the roof of the narrator's apartment building, contemplating the vast city below, a symbol of both the enormity of their task and the potential for discovery that lies within its depths.
