The narrative begins with a lively discussion among six individuals at a League meeting about the future of society after a revolution. One man, who remains unnamed, leaves the meeting feeling discontented and preoccupied with thoughts of a utopian society. As he travels home by train, he muses on the possibility of witnessing such a society.

Upon arriving home, he quickly falls asleep but awakens in a state of heightened awareness, reflecting on his life's mistakes and entanglements with amusement. He eventually falls back asleep, only to awaken to surprising adventures that he feels compelled to share. He decides to narrate these experiences in the first person, as he feels a deep connection to the protagonist of his story.

The narrative then shifts to a conversation between the unnamed narrator and an old man named Hammond, who provides insights into the societal changes that have occurred. Hammond discusses the concept of education in this new society, emphasizing the importance of personal growth and inclination rather than the forced education of the past. He describes a society where poverty has been eradicated, allowing for real education and personal development.

Hammond also explains the transformation of cities, particularly London, which has shed its industrial past to become a more pleasant and populous place. He describes annual celebrations commemorating the end of poverty and the transformation of slums into beautiful meadows. The narrator learns about the disappearance of manufacturing districts and the spread of population across the countryside, leading to a harmonious blend of town and country life.

The narrative continues with a discussion of governance, where Hammond explains that traditional government structures have been replaced by a system where the people collectively manage their affairs without the need for elaborate government machinery. The narrator learns that the society operates on mutual cooperation and the absence of private property, leading to the abolition of civil and criminal law as understood in the past.

The story delves into the arrangement of life in this new society, where traditional concepts of crime and punishment are replaced by a focus on personal responsibility and atonement. The narrator learns that the society emphasizes the importance of personal growth, happiness, and the pleasure of work, with individuals pursuing occupations that align with their interests and abilities.

The narrative explores the political landscape, where the absence of traditional politics is highlighted, and the focus is on practical decision-making and communal well-being. The narrator is introduced to a society that values the will of the majority and the resolution of differences through discussion and consensus.

As the story unfolds, the narrator experiences the beauty and harmony of this new world, where the countryside is a garden, and life is leisurely yet fulfilling. He learns about the societal changes that have led to this utopia, including the end of class divisions and the establishment of a communal way of life.

The narrator's journey concludes with reflections on the transformation of society, the importance of happiness and personal fulfillment, and the realization that this new world represents a vision of hope and peace. The narrative ends with the narrator waking up in his own world, pondering the possibility that his experiences were a vision rather than a dream, and feeling inspired by the hope of a better future.
