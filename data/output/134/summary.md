Maria, a woman of strong emotions and intellect, finds herself confined in a dismal prison-like mansion, grappling with the despair of her situation. Her husband, Mr. Venables, a man devoid of principle, has orchestrated her confinement, and she is tormented by the thought of her infant daughter, who has been taken from her. Maria's mind is a whirlwind of emotions, ranging from rage and indignation to tenderness and maternal anxiety. She is determined to escape, not just for her own sake but to save her child from the ills of life that seem inevitable for women.

In her isolation, Maria reflects on her life and the events that led her to this point. She recalls her childhood, marked by a strict and tyrannical father, and the solace she found in her uncle, a man of intellect and feeling who became her mentor. Her marriage to Mr. Venables was a means of escape from her oppressive home life, but it quickly turned into a trap. Her husband, initially attentive, soon revealed his true nature as a gambler and libertine, indifferent to her feelings and happiness.

Throughout her narrative, Maria interweaves reflections on the oppressive state of women in society, lamenting the lack of opportunities and the societal norms that bind them to unhappy marriages. Her thoughts are further fueled by the stories of Jemima, her attendant, who has suffered her own share of injustices and hardships. Jemima's life has been a series of struggles, from being born a bastard and enduring abuse, to being forced into a life of servitude and theft for survival. Despite her hard exterior, Jemima's humanity has not been entirely extinguished, and she becomes an ally to Maria.

Maria's only solace comes from her correspondence with Henry Darnford, another inmate in the mansion. Through their exchanged letters, they develop a deep connection, sharing their thoughts on freedom, society, and the human condition. Darnford, like Maria, is a victim of circumstance, confined due to a distant relative's scheming. Their bond grows stronger, and they find in each other a kindred spirit, both longing for liberty and understanding.

As Maria plans her escape, she entrusts Jemima with the task of finding her daughter. Jemima, moved by Maria's plight and the prospect of a better life, agrees to help. However, Maria's hopes are dashed when she learns from Jemima that her child has died. This devastating news plunges Maria into deeper despair, yet she finds some comfort in Darnford's love and the promise of a future together.

The narrative ends with Maria's reflections on her life and the societal constraints that have shaped it. She expresses a fervent hope for her daughter's future, urging her to seek happiness and independence, and to learn from her mother's mistakes. Maria's story is a poignant exploration of the struggles faced by women, the quest for personal freedom, and the enduring power of love and resilience in the face of adversity.
