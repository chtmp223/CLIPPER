Sir Walter Elliot of Kellynch Hall, a man obsessed with his own status and appearance, faces financial difficulties that necessitate renting out his family estate. His eldest daughter, Elizabeth, shares his vanity, while his youngest, Anne Elliot, is sensible and overlooked by her father. Lady Russell, a close family friend, advises Sir Walter on financial matters and supports the decision to let Kellynch Hall to Admiral Croft, a naval officer.

Anne, who had once been engaged to Captain Frederick Wentworth, Admiral Croft's brother-in-law, is deeply affected by the news of the Crofts moving into Kellynch. Eight years prior, Anne broke off her engagement to Wentworth due to Lady Russell's persuasion, who deemed the match imprudent. The decision left Anne heartbroken, and she has since lived a life of quiet resignation.

The Musgroves of Uppercross, neighbors to Kellynch, are a lively and welcoming family. Anne's younger sister, Mary, is married to Charles Musgrove, and Anne often visits them. The Musgroves' daughters, Louisa and Henrietta, become enamored with Captain Wentworth when he visits the area. Anne, who still harbors feelings for Wentworth, struggles with seeing him again, especially as he seems to pay attention to the Musgrove sisters.

Wentworth, initially indifferent to Anne, gradually reveals his enduring feelings for her. Meanwhile, Mr. Elliot, the heir presumptive to Sir Walter’s baronetcy, re-enters the family circle, charming Elizabeth and Sir Walter. However, Anne learns from her friend, Mrs. Smith, that Mr. Elliot is manipulative and self-serving, further complicating the social dynamics.

As the story unfolds, Louisa Musgrove suffers an accident, leading to her engagement to Captain Benwick, a friend of Wentworth. This development frees Wentworth from any perceived obligation towards Louisa, allowing him to focus on his feelings for Anne. The narrative culminates in Bath, where Wentworth and Anne reconcile their past misunderstandings and renew their engagement.

Lady Russell comes to accept Wentworth, recognizing Anne’s happiness as paramount. The novel concludes with Anne and Wentworth's marriage, a union based on mutual respect and enduring love, while Sir Walter and Elizabeth remain entrenched in their superficial pursuits.
