In the novel, the story unfolds in the realm of Dauphiny, where the Seneschal, Monsieur de Tressan, is embroiled in the affairs of the Chateau de Condillac. The narrative begins with Tressan, a corpulent and complacent official, being visited by the Dowager Marquise of Condillac, who seeks his assistance in a matter concerning her stepson, Florimond de Condillac, and his betrothed, Valerie de La Vauvraye.

Florimond, the elder son of the late Marquis de Condillac, is absent, serving in the Italian wars, leaving his stepmother, the Dowager Marquise, and her son, Marius, in control of the chateau. The Marquise harbors ambitions for her son to marry Valerie, a wealthy heiress, thereby consolidating power and wealth. Valerie, however, is bound by a promise to marry Florimond, a union orchestrated by their fathers.

The Queen-Regent of France, upon learning of Valerie's plight through a letter she sent, dispatches Martin Marie Rigobert de Garnache, a seasoned soldier, to Dauphiny to ensure Valerie's release and safe conduct to Paris. Garnache's mission is complicated by the cunning and treachery of the Marquise and Marius, who are determined to hold Valerie at Condillac and force her into marriage with Marius.

Garnache, a man of action and fiery temper, arrives in Grenoble and confronts Tressan, demanding his cooperation. Tressan, torn between his loyalty to the crown and his affection for the Marquise, attempts to appease both parties but ultimately leans towards aiding Garnache, albeit reluctantly.

Garnache's attempts to liberate Valerie are fraught with obstacles, including a failed attempt where the Marquise sends a peasant girl in Valerie's stead. Undeterred, Garnache infiltrates Condillac in disguise, posing as an Italian mercenary named Battista. His ruse allows him to become Valerie's gaoler, providing him the opportunity to plan her escape.

The narrative is punctuated by tense confrontations, including a night-time skirmish where Garnache's true identity is revealed, leading to a desperate flight from the chateau. Despite the odds, Garnache manages to escape into the moat, presumed drowned by his pursuers.

The story reaches a turning point when Garnache, having survived, returns to Condillac with reinforcements disguised as monks, led by the Abbot of Saint Francis. This strategic move allows him to overpower the Marquise's forces and secure Valerie's freedom.

In the aftermath, the Marquise is compelled to surrender, and Tressan, implicated in the Marquise's schemes, is coerced into marrying her to avoid prosecution. Valerie, grateful for Garnache's bravery and steadfastness, confesses her affection for him, leading to a tender resolution between them.

Florimond, who had been delayed by illness, returns to find the situation resolved, and the narrative closes with the promise of a new beginning for Valerie and Garnache, who have found love amidst the turmoil and intrigue of Condillac. The novel weaves a tale of loyalty, courage, and the complexities of duty, set against the backdrop of political machinations and personal ambitions.
