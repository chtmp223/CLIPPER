The story begins in June 1751, with young David Balfour leaving his home in Essendean after the death of his parents. He is given a letter by the local minister, Mr. Campbell, to deliver to his uncle, Ebenezer Balfour, at the House of Shaws near Cramond. Despite warnings and strange reactions from locals about the Shaws, David sets off on his journey. Upon arrival, he finds the house in disrepair and his uncle Ebenezer a miserly and suspicious man. David's initial excitement turns to unease as he notices his uncle's peculiar behavior.

Ebenezer reluctantly allows David to stay, but their relationship is strained. David learns from a local that his uncle might have murdered his father to inherit the estate. Ebenezer attempts to kill David by sending him up a dangerous staircase in the dark. Realizing the danger, David confronts his uncle, who feigns innocence but is clearly hiding something.

The next day, Ebenezer takes David to meet Captain Hoseason of the brig Covenant, under the pretense of discussing business. Once on board, David is tricked and knocked unconscious, realizing later that he has been kidnapped to be sold into slavery in the Carolinas. Aboard the Covenant, David meets the cruel crew and learns the harsh realities of life at sea.

During a storm, the ship collides with a small boat, and a survivor, Alan Breck Stewart, comes aboard. Alan is a Jacobite with a price on his head, carrying money for his exiled chief. David and Alan form an alliance against the crew, who plan to kill Alan for his money. Together, they defend themselves in a fierce battle, with David proving his courage.

After the fight, the Covenant is shipwrecked on the coast of Scotland, and David and Alan are separated. David survives and makes his way through the Highlands, eventually reuniting with Alan. Together, they embark on a journey to evade capture by the redcoats and to clear Alan's name from a murder charge.

Their journey is fraught with danger and hardship, as they navigate the rugged landscape and avoid soldiers. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including Cluny Macpherson, who shelters them in his hidden cave, and Robin Oig, son of the infamous Rob Roy.

David learns of his rightful inheritance and the treachery of his uncle Ebenezer. With the help of Mr. Rankeillor, a lawyer, David confronts his uncle and secures his rightful place as the heir to the House of Shaws. Alan, still a fugitive, plans to escape to France, and the two friends part ways with a heartfelt goodbye.

Throughout the story, themes of loyalty, courage, and justice are explored, as David grows from a naive boy into a resourceful and determined young man. The novel captures the historical and cultural tensions of 18th-century Scotland, blending adventure with a coming-of-age narrative.
