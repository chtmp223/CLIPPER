In the story, a group of children—Cyril, Anthea, Robert, and Jane—are in possession of a magical carpet that grants wishes, and a Phoenix that accompanies them on their adventures. The tale begins with the children returning from a holiday only to find themselves locked out of their house. They eventually manage to get inside with the help of the Phoenix and discover that their servants have gone out without permission. This sets the stage for several magical adventures, each filled with unexpected challenges and lessons.

The children decide to use the carpet to wish for good deeds, leading them to a variety of places. However, their wishes often have unintended consequences. For instance, when they wish for beautiful and delightful things, the carpet brings back 199 Persian cats, creating chaos in their home. The children struggle to manage the cats, and a policeman nearly discovers their secret. The Phoenix cleverly distracts the policeman, allowing the children to avoid trouble.

Another adventure involves a burglar whom the children accidentally involve in their magical escapades. They feel responsible for him and decide to help him when he is arrested for possessing stolen cats. They plan to rescue him using the carpet and take him to a sunny southern shore where their former cook is now queen. The burglar, who turns out to be a decent man led astray by circumstances, is grateful and agrees to start a new life there.

Throughout their adventures, the children learn the importance of responsibility and the consequences of their wishes. They also realize the value of being kind and helpful to others. The Phoenix, with its wisdom and magical abilities, guides them, often with a touch of humor and a lesson to impart.

The story concludes with the children reflecting on their experiences. They have learned to appreciate the ordinary aspects of life and the importance of using their magical gifts wisely. The Phoenix continues to be a mentor and friend, ready to assist them in future adventures, while the carpet, though worn from its many journeys, remains a cherished possession.

The narrative is rich with themes of adventure, magic, and the moral complexities of using power responsibly. The children’s interactions with the Phoenix and the magical carpet drive the plot, leading to humorous and heartwarming outcomes that teach valuable lessons about life, friendship, and family.
