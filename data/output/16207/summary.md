In a remote region of New Brunswick, the Dubois family, originally from France, resides in a respectable two-story house by the Miramichi River. The family consists of Mr. Dubois, his wife, and their daughter, Adèle, who is sixteen. Mr. Dubois, a man of dignity and integrity, is well-respected in the area, while Mrs. Dubois is gentle and gracious, often lost in memories of her homeland. Adèle is a striking young girl, tall and graceful, with a delicate foreign accent and a strong will. She carries the charm and authority of a young queen among the settlers, who are mostly rough, lawless, and engaged in fishing and lumbering.

The region is known for its wildness and vice, becoming a refuge for outlaws. Into this setting arrives Mr. Norton, a missionary from the United States, whose heart is full of compassion and a desire to bring the message of heavenly love to these dwellers in darkness. Having traveled through the wilderness, Mr. Norton finds shelter at the Dubois house, where he is welcomed warmly.

As Mr. Norton becomes acquainted with the Dubois family, he learns of their background and the struggles they have faced in this new land. Mrs. Dubois shares her longing for her native Picardy, where she spent her childhood in a chateau surrounded by beauty and art. She tells Adèle about her early life, her marriage to Mr. Dubois, and their decision to leave France for New Brunswick, hoping to build a new life.

Adèle, in turn, becomes fascinated by her mother's stories and the rich history of her family. She dreams of visiting the places her mother describes and feels a deep connection to her heritage. Meanwhile, Mr. Norton, with the help of Micah Mummychog, a rugged but good-hearted settler, begins to organize gatherings in a nearby grove to preach to the community. Despite initial resistance, his genuine kindness and powerful oratory start to draw people in.
