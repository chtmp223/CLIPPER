Glen Mason, a boy at the State Industrial School for Boys, known as the Reform School, is determined to escape and start a new life. He is inspired by his friend Nixon's plan to escape during a visit to the dentist by changing clothes and sneaking out of the building at night. Despite the school's honor system, Glen is skeptical and believes he can find a way to escape and never return. His primary motivation is to return home as a hero rather than a penitent.

Glen manages to earn a trip to the dentist by faking a toothache. Once there, he executes his escape plan, changing clothes and hiding until the building is empty. He climbs down the fire escape but falls into a rain barrel. Undeterred, he continues his journey, eventually finding himself in a park. There, he saves a young boy from falling out of a car, earning the gratitude of the boy's family, the Gates.

The Gates family takes Glen in for a couple of days, showing him kindness and trust. However, when Glen sees a newspaper article about his escape, he feels ashamed and leaves early in the morning. On the road, he encounters a peddler named J. Jervice, who offers him a ride to town. However, Jervice plans to turn Glen in for a reward. Glen manages to escape Jervice's trap and hides in an old quarry, where he finds tools that he later tries to trade for food and a hat. His attempt fails, and he is chased by a policeman, leading to a collision with Jolly Bill, a cheerful and disabled young man in a wheelchair.

Jolly Bill invites Glen to stay with him and his mother, offering him a chance to help with a treasure hunt based on an old story about bullion hidden by Indians in a drained lake called Buffalo Hollow. Glen agrees to help and learns about the Boy Scouts camping nearby. He becomes friends with scouts like Apple Newton and Chick-chick, and even though he initially clashes with Matt Burton, a patrol leader, he gradually earns the respect of the scouts.

Glen is initiated as a tenderfoot scout and joins the treasure hunt. The scouts explore Buffalo Hollow, looking for signs of old watercourses that might lead to the hidden springs and the treasure. Glen and his friends face various challenges, including a confrontation with J. Jervice and his gang, who are planning to rob a bank. Glen and Chick-chick manage to thwart the gang's plan by taking their car and informing the sheriff, leading to the gang's capture.

The scouts eventually discover a cave in Buffalo Mound, where they find a hidden watercourse that begins to refill Buffalo Lake. This discovery is significant for Jolly Bill's plan to sell the lakefront property. Glen's bravery and resourcefulness throughout these adventures lead to his parole from the reform school, allowing him to return home to his family and work for Mr. Gates.

The story concludes with Glen visiting the scout camp a year later, where he is warmly welcomed by his friends. The camp is now named Camp Mason in his honor, and Jolly Bill has successfully undergone surgery to improve his mobility. Glen's journey from a troubled boy to a respected scout and community member highlights themes of redemption, friendship, and the transformative power of trust and kindness.
