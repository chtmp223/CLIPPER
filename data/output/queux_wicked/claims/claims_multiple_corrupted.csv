   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the claim incorrectly identifies Hickman as a Bulgarian spy and incorrectly states the method of poisoning as a drink.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it misrepresents Hickman's role and the method of poisoning.

Since 1a., 1b., and 2a. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
