The mongoose purchased by Adam from Ross in Liverpool for killing snakes is later shot and killed by Lady Arabella when it aggressively attacks her.,The mongoose purchased by Adam from Ross in Liverpool for killing snakes is later shot and killed by Edgar Caswall when it aggressively attacks him.,"In Chapter 4, Adam specifically buys a mongoose from Ross in Liverpool for the purpose of killing snakes. Later, in Chapter 7, this same mongoose is shot and killed by Lady Arabella when it aggressively attacks her. This demonstrates a clear cause-and-effect relationship between Adam's purchase and the mongoose's eventual fate.","The outline clearly states that Lady Arabella, not Edgar Caswall, shoots and kills the mongoose, making this corrupted fact incorrect.","Chapter 4, 7","- Chapter 4, item 5: Adam visits Ross, an animal merchant in Liverpool, to purchase a mongoose for killing snakes.

- Relationship: Cause and effect, central element (mongoose)",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""The mongoose purchased by Adam from Ross in Liverpool for killing snakes"": This part is grounded in event 4 of Chapter 4, where Adam visits Ross, an animal merchant in Liverpool, to purchase a mongoose for killing snakes.
   b. ""is later shot and killed by Lady Arabella when it aggressively attacks her"": This part is grounded in event 7 of Chapter 7, where Lady Arabella shoots and kills the mongoose when it aggressively attacks her.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The claim establishes a sequence of events where the mongoose, initially purchased for a specific purpose, is later involved in an incident leading to its death.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation or assumption; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline. There is no contradicting information in the summary or outline regarding these events.

   a. ""The mongoose purchased by Adam from Ross in Liverpool for killing snakes"": This part is grounded in event 4 of Chapter 4, where Adam visits Ross to purchase a mongoose for killing snakes.
   b. ""is later shot and killed by Edgar Caswall when it aggressively attacks him"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. In Chapter 7, it is mentioned that Lady Arabella shoots and kills the mongoose when it aggressively attacks her, not Edgar Caswall.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not valid because the claim incorrectly states that Edgar Caswall shoots the mongoose, whereas the chapter outline specifies that Lady Arabella is the one who shoots it.
   b. The relationship is a misinterpretation of the events described in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it contradicts the specific details provided.

Since the second atomic part is not grounded in the chapter outline and the relationship is based on incorrect information, the claim is INVALID."
