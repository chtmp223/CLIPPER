<litdev>The story features:
- Vivid scientific imagery, particularly when describing quantum phenomena and parallel realities.
- Metaphors and similes that compare abstract quantum concepts to tangible, relatable experiences.
- Juxtaposition of cutting-edge technology with philosophical and ethical dilemmas.
- Fast-paced action sequences interspersed with moments of quiet introspection.
- Dialogue that balances technical jargon with emotional depth, revealing character relationships and motivations.
- Foreshadowing and parallel storylines across multiple realities to create a complex, interwoven narrative.
- Symbolism related to weaving, tapestries, and interconnectedness to reinforce the theme of quantum entanglement.

<lexchoice>The diction is a careful blend of scientific terminology and accessible language, designed to convey complex quantum concepts to a general audience. It incorporates futuristic tech jargon and neologisms to build the world of Neo-Shanghai and beyond. The language becomes more lyrical and abstract when describing the quantum realm and parallel realities, employing vivid sensory details to make the incomprehensible tangible. There's a notable use of physics and mathematics vocabulary, balanced with emotive language to explore the human impact of scientific discoveries. Regional variations in language may be present as characters traverse different realities, adding depth to the multiverse concept.</lexchoice>
