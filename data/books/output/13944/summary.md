In a post-apocalyptic world, the remnants of civilization are scattered across a landscape transformed by time and nature. Felix Aquila, the eldest son of Baron Constans, lives in the Old House, a fortified estate surrounded by a stockade. The family struggles under the weight of debt and political obscurity, despite their noble lineage. Felix, a contemplative and scholarly young man, is often at odds with his more physically robust and outgoing brother, Oliver. Their father, once a respected warrior, has retreated into a life of mechanical invention and agriculture, leaving the family vulnerable to the machinations of court politics.

Felix dreams of exploration and independence, constructing a canoe for a secret voyage on the great Lake that now dominates the center of the land. The Lake, formed by the backflow of ancient rivers like the Thames and Severn, is a vast body of fresh water, teeming with fish and dotted with islands. Yet, it also serves as a conduit for the Irish and Welsh invaders, who vie for control of the territories around its shores.

The world outside the Old House is fraught with danger. The remnants of humanity are divided into various tribes and kingdoms, each with its own customs and conflicts. The Bushmen, a nomadic and lawless people, roam the forests, while the Romany and Zingari, or gipsies, pose a constant threat with their raids and feuds. The social order is maintained through a rigid class system, where literacy is the privilege of the nobility, and the majority of the population lives in servitude.

Felix's journey is both physical and philosophical. He seeks to escape the confines of his family's declining fortunes and the oppressive political climate. As he ventures into the Lake, he encounters the ruins of ancient cities, now overgrown and forgotten, their secrets lost to time. These explorations are not without peril; the marshes of the old metropolis are deadly, shrouded in toxic vapors that claim the lives of those who dare to search for the treasures of the past.

Despite the dangers, Felix's determination is fueled by his love for Aurora Thyma, a noblewoman who shares his dreams of a better world. Their correspondence, preserved in precious letters, is a testament to his aspirations. Felix envisions a future where he can establish a new settlement, a place of learning and prosperity, free from the tyranny of the existing order.

Meanwhile, Oliver, frustrated by his lack of advancement in the military, longs for action and recognition. The brothers' relationship is complex, marked by a mixture of rivalry and mutual respect. Their differing paths highlight the tension between tradition and innovation, physical prowess and intellectual pursuit.

As Felix navigates the challenges of his environment, he grapples with the broader implications of power and freedom. He witnesses the corruption and brutality of those who wield authority, as well as the resilience and ingenuity of those who resist it. His journey is a microcosm of the larger struggle for control and survival in a fractured world.

Ultimately, Felix's quest is one of self-discovery and transformation. He learns to reconcile his ideals with the harsh realities of life, finding strength in his convictions and the courage to pursue his vision. His story is a reflection on the enduring human spirit and the quest for meaning in a world where the past is both a burden and a source of inspiration.
