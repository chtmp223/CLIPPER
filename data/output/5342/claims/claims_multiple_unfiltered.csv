   a. ""The children's school playground fundraising efforts result in various contributions"": This part is grounded in the chapter outlines, where the children are involved in fundraising efforts for a school library, not specifically a playground. The summary also supports their efforts to collect money for a school library fund.
   b. ""including a dollar each from the Awkward Man at Silver Milestone"": This part is partially grounded in the chapter outline. The children receive a quarter each from the Awkward Man at Golden Milestone, not Silver Milestone.

The outline states that Mr. Campbell gives five dollars after being impressed by the Story Girl's storytelling, not a song, and there is no mention of Mrs. Campbell or a ten-dollar contribution.
