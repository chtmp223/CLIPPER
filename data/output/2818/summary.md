The story centers around Beautiful Joe, a dog who narrates his life experiences, beginning with a traumatic and abusive early life under the ownership of a cruel milkman named Jenkins in the town of Fairport, Maine. Jenkins is a violent man who mistreats Joe and his mother, Jess, as well as other animals in his care. Joe's life takes a turn for the worse when Jenkins mutilates him by cutting off his ears and tail as punishment for biting him. 

Joe's fortune changes when a young man named Harry Morris rescues him from Jenkins' brutality. Harry takes Joe to his family, the Morris family, who live in a warm, loving home. The family consists of Mr. Morris, a clergyman; Mrs. Morris, a kind and gentle woman; their daughter, Miss Laura, and their sons, Jack, Ned, Carl, and Willie. The Morris family is compassionate and takes in Joe, nursing him back to health and integrating him into their household, which is full of other pets and animals.

Miss Laura, in particular, becomes very attached to Joe, and through her care and affection, Joe begins to heal both physically and emotionally. The family also includes other animals, such as a fox terrier named Billy, a parrot named Bella, and various other pets like rabbits and guinea pigs. Each animal has its own story and relationship with the Morris family, illustrating the family's dedication to animal welfare.

The Morris family is committed to kindness and humane treatment of animals, a theme that runs throughout the book. They believe in educating others about the importance of treating animals with respect and compassion. This is demonstrated through various interactions with other characters, such as Mrs. Montague, who learns from Mrs. Morris about the importance of empathy towards animals and people alike.

Joe's life with the Morrises is filled with care and love, contrasting sharply with his early experiences. The family's efforts to rehabilitate Joe and other animals showcase the transformative power of kindness. Joe becomes an integral part of the family, learning to trust humans again, and observing the family's interactions with each other and their pets.

The story also touches on broader social issues, such as the treatment of animals in society, the responsibilities of pet ownership, and the moral lessons that can be learned from caring for animals. Through Joe's eyes, readers witness the impact of cruelty and neglect, as well as the healing power of love and compassion.

The narrative concludes with Joe reflecting on his life with the Morrises, expressing gratitude for the love he received, and highlighting the ongoing commitment of the family to animal welfare. Joe's story serves as a testament to the importance of empathy and the positive difference it can make in the lives of both animals and humans.
