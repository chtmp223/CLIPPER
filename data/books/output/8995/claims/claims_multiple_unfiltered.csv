    a. ""Katy's sea voyage from America to Europe began when she boarded the Spartacus with Mrs. Ashe and Amy"": This part is grounded in event 7 of Chapter 3, where Katy boards the steamer with Mrs. Ashe and Amy, departing for Europe.
    b. ""concluded when they docked in London, where they disembarked and took a train to their hotel"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. According to event 7 of Chapter 4, the Spartacus docks in Liverpool, not London, and Katy and Mrs. Ashe take a hansom cab to their hotel, not a train.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not valid because the claim incorrectly states that the voyage concluded in London, whereas the chapter outline specifies Liverpool as the docking location.
    b. The relationship is not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline, as the claim introduces an incorrect detail about the location of disembarkation.
    c. The relationship contradicts the information in the chapter outline regarding the docking location and mode of transportation to the hotel.

Since 1b. and 2a. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
