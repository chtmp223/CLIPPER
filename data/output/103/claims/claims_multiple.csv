In Chapter 3, Fogg initially accepts a wager of 4,000 pounds from Stuart, but he later increases the stakes to 20,000 pounds against anyone who wishes to bet. Therefore, the claim of winning a 4,000-pound wager is not accurate as per the final wager amount.

   a. The relationship between winning the wager and entering the Reform Club at 9 p.m. is meaningful and grounded in the chapter outline, as Fogg's timely arrival is crucial to winning the wager.
