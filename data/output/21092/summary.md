In a futuristic world where space travel and colonization have become commonplace, three young cadets of the Space Academy—Tom Corbett, Roger Manning, and Astro—embark on an adventure of danger and intrigue. They are part of the Space Cadet Corps, a prestigious organization tasked with maintaining peace and order across the Solar Alliance. The story begins with the cadets returning from leave, only to encounter two suspicious men, Gus Wallace and Luther Simms, who later become central figures in the unfolding drama.

At the Solar Exposition on Venus, the cadets discover a plot involving Wallace and Simms, who are using an old spaceship as a front for smuggling operations. The cadets' suspicions are confirmed when they learn that the duo has stolen a crucial sound spool from a time capsule, containing the secret of an adjustable light-key. This device can open any energy lock in the solar system, posing a grave threat to security.

Captain Steve Strong, the cadets' commanding officer, leads a rigorous search for Wallace and Simms. The pursuit takes them to various locations, including the rough neighborhoods of Luna City and Marsopolis, where they gather intelligence from underworld figures. Their investigation eventually leads them to the notorious Bull Coxine, a former mutineer and master criminal, who orchestrates the thefts from behind the scenes.

Coxine's ultimate goal is to amass a fleet of stolen ships and weapons, using the adjustable light-key to unlock vaults and armories. His plan threatens the stability of the Solar Alliance, as he aims to establish a new order under his rule. The cadets, along with Captain Strong, race against time to stop Coxine's reign of terror.

The climax occurs when Coxine, using the captured Space Cadet ship Polaris, plans an audacious attack on the Ganymede colony. The cadets, captured and held prisoner, manage to send a distress signal, alerting the Solar Guard. In a daring rescue, Captain Strong and the Solar Guard fleet engage Coxine's forces in a fierce battle. Astro, in a display of raw strength and courage, defeats Coxine in hand-to-hand combat, while Tom and Roger assist in disabling the pirate's ship.

With Coxine and his crew apprehended, peace is restored to the Solar Alliance. The cadets, having demonstrated bravery and quick thinking, reflect on their experiences. They realize that being a Space Cadet is not just about technical knowledge but also about courage, teamwork, and the willingness to risk everything for the greater good. The story concludes with the cadets and Captain Strong united in their commitment to protecting the solar system from any future threats.
