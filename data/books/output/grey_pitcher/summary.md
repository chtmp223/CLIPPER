Ken Ward, a freshman at a large university, quickly discovers the harsh realities of college life. Coming from a significant role in his high school and after a summer of thrilling adventures in Arizona, Ken feels diminished and overlooked among the four thousand students at the university. His initial attempts at camaraderie with upperclassmen are met with ridicule, leading him to become withdrawn and lonely. Despite his size and strength, Ken feels insignificant and struggles to find his place.

Ken's awkwardness is compounded by the strict social hierarchy, where freshmen are regularly humiliated by sophomores and ignored by seniors. His encounters with sophomores are particularly tough, as they seem to take pleasure in belittling him. Ken's isolation grows as he navigates the campus, careful to avoid further embarrassment.

The university's vastness and the overwhelming number of students make Ken feel small, and his attempts to engage with others often result in mockery. However, Ken is determined to persevere. He finds solace in his studies, particularly in the forestry department, where he is passionate about learning. Ken spends his free time in the library or attending lectures, trying to distract himself from his social struggles.

One afternoon, Ken stumbles into a lecture hall filled with students. Unaware of the social rules, he sits in a row reserved for sophomores. This act inadvertently challenges the sophomores, leading to a confrontation. Ken's defiance sparks a physical altercation, a tug-of-war between freshmen and sophomores, which ends with Ken being stripped of his clothes and the freshmen claiming victory.

Despite the humiliation, Ken's actions earn him a degree of respect from his fellow freshmen. The incident marks a turning point for Ken, who begins to feel a sense of belonging. Encouraged by his newfound camaraderie, Ken becomes more involved in university life, though he remains cautious of the sophomores' revenge.

Ken's journey is one of resilience and determination, as he navigates the challenges of freshman year, balancing his academic ambitions with the social complexities of university life. Through his struggles, Ken learns the importance of perseverance, friendship, and standing up for oneself, ultimately finding his place in the collegiate world.
