Later, in Chapter 24, during the raid on the tramp camp, Tom tackles Featherton to recover a black valise, but Morse kicks Tom in the process. This fact demonstrates the recurring antagonistic relationship between Tom and Morse, involving physical confrontations in different locations and contexts.","The corrupted fact incorrectly states that Morse helped Tom tackle Featherton, when in reality, Morse kicked Tom during this confrontation, maintaining his antagonistic role.","Chapter 3, 24","- Chapter 3, item 3: Morse threatens Tom and attempts to physically assault him on the deserted street.

- Relationship: Recurring antagonist (Morse) and physical confrontations",Unique,Valid claim,VALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Anson Morse, who threatened and attempted to assault Tom on a deserted street in Mansburg"": This part is grounded in events 2 and 3 of Chapter 3, where Morse threatens and attempts to assault Tom.
   b. ""later kicked Tom during a confrontation when Tom tackled Featherton to recover a black valise containing stolen money"": This part is grounded in events 4 and 5 of Chapter 24, where Tom tackles Featherton and is kicked by Morse.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The claim establishes a sequence of events involving Anson Morse's actions towards Tom, first in Chapter 3 and later in Chapter 24.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as both parts of the claim are consistent with the events described.
