The narrative unfolds aboard the steamer _Kut Sang_, a cargo ship sailing from Manila to Hong-Kong. The story is told from the perspective of James Augustus Trenholm, a war correspondent who finds himself embroiled in a mysterious and dangerous situation.

Trenholm begins his journey in Manila, where he encounters the Rev. Luther Meeker, a suspicious missionary, and a red-headed beggar named Petrak. Meeker seems to be following Trenholm, and as events unfold, it becomes apparent that both Meeker and Petrak are involved in a deeper plot. Trenholm also meets Mr. Trego, a man of mystery who turns out to be the supercargo of the _Kut Sang_, although he initially poses as a passenger.

As the _Kut Sang_ sets sail, tensions rise. Captain Riggs, the old and experienced master of the ship, is unaware of the true nature of his passengers and the cargo he carries. It is revealed that the ship's cargo includes something far more valuable than mere machinery, which is being guarded with intense secrecy.

Trenholm quickly becomes a suspect in a murder aboard the ship when Trego is found dead, stabbed with a sailor's knife. The red-headed Petrak accuses Trenholm of being involved, claiming that Trenholm paid him for the murder. This accusation is part of a larger plot orchestrated by Meeker, who is not a missionary but a spy, possibly working for the Japanese. Meeker had been trying to prevent Trenholm from boarding the _Kut Sang_ because he suspected Trenholm of being a Russian spy.

As the ship sails into the China Sea, the situation deteriorates. Harris, the mate, becomes suspicious of the cargo and the passengers, especially after the murder of Trego. He discovers that the cargo, marked as tinned milk, is actually something far more valuable, possibly gold, which explains the presence of the mysterious supercargo.

The tension culminates in a series of violent confrontations. Harris and Captain Riggs attempt to uncover the truth but are met with resistance and further violence from the crew, who are revealed to be part of a mutinous plot. The ship becomes a battleground as alliances shift and betrayals unfold.

Trenholm, realizing the danger he is in, decides to spy on the unfolding events to clear his name and survive. He discovers that Meeker, also known as Thirkle, is the mastermind behind the plot, aiming to seize the valuable cargo. Thirkle's men, including Petrak and Buckrow, are revealed to be pirates, and the _Kut Sang_ is caught in a deadly game of mutiny and murder on the high seas.

The story is a thrilling sea adventure filled with intrigue, betrayal, and the fight for survival. As Trenholm navigates the treacherous waters of deception and danger, he must use his wits to outmaneuver the pirates and prove his innocence before the _Kut Sang_ meets its fate.
