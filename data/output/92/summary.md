Lieutenant Albert Werper, exiled to a remote Congo post for dishonor, becomes embroiled in a series of events leading him to the jungle and the notorious Achmet Zek, an Arab raider. Werper, desiring wealth and redemption, joins forces with Achmet Zek, who plans to kidnap Jane Clayton, wife of Tarzan, to ransom her for gold. Meanwhile, Tarzan, stripped of his memory due to a head injury, reverts to his primal instincts and roams the jungle, unaware of his identity as John Clayton, Lord Greystoke.

Jane Clayton is captured by Achmet Zek's men as they raid and destroy her home. In the chaos, Mugambi, a loyal ally of Tarzan, survives the attack and vows revenge. Werper, who has been following Tarzan to steal his wealth, discovers Tarzan's amnesia and decides to exploit it for his gain. He leads Tarzan back toward civilization, hoping to retrieve the jewels of Opar, a treasure Tarzan had previously hidden.

In Opar, Tarzan unknowingly retrieves a pouch of precious gems, mistaking them for mere pebbles. Werper, driven by greed, plots to steal the jewels, while Tarzan is drawn to the ancient city of Opar by instinct. There, the high priestess La, who loves Tarzan, attempts to sacrifice Werper. Tarzan, with his primal strength and agility, saves Werper and they escape the city, though Werper continues to covet the jewels.

As they journey, Tarzan's forgotten identity and skills aid them in surviving the jungle's dangers. They encounter Tarzan's Waziri warriors, who are returning with gold ingots from Opar. Werper, still scheming, plans to betray Tarzan and the Waziri to Achmet Zek by revealing the location of the treasure.

Achmet Zek's raiders, meanwhile, pursue Jane Clayton to sell her into slavery. She is taken north by Abdul Mourak, an Abyssinian, who plans to present her to his emperor. During a lion attack on Mourak's camp, Jane narrowly escapes death, only to be recaptured by Achmet Zek's men.

Tarzan, regaining partial memory, senses danger to his wife and rushes to her aid. He arrives in time to save Jane from a lion, revealing his identity to her. Together, they plan to return to their home, unaware of Werper's ongoing betrayal.

Werper, left alone, retrieves the hidden jewels from Tarzan's makeshift cache and flees. Tarzan, unaware of the theft, focuses on reuniting with Jane and rebuilding their lives. As they travel back to their devastated estate, they find Mugambi and the Waziri, who join them in a joyful reunion.

The story concludes with Tarzan and Jane beginning to restore their home and community, while Werper, burdened by his stolen treasure and guilt, faces an uncertain future. The narrative explores themes of identity, loyalty, and the primal instincts that both drive and redeem the characters in their intertwined fates.
