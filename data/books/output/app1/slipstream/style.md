<lexchoice>The diction is a careful blend of scientific jargon and lyrical prose, creating a unique voice that bridges the gap between hard science and mysticism. Technical terms from quantum physics are interwoven with more accessible language to maintain reader engagement. There's a notable use of neologisms and repurposed scientific terms to describe new concepts within the story's universe. The language becomes more fluid and dreamlike when describing altered states of reality or quantum experiences, contrasting with sharper, more precise language during moments of conflict or scientific exposition. Regional variations are minimal, focusing instead on the global nature of scientific pursuit and the universal implications of quantum manipulation.</lexchoice>
