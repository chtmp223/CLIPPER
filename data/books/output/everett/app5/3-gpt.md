## Chapter 1


T**HOSE LITTLE BASTARDS** were hiding out there in the tall grass. The moon was not quite full, but bright, and it was behind them, so I could see them as plain as day, though it was deep night. Lightning bugs flashed against the black canvas. I waited at Miss Watson’s kitchen door, rocked a loose step board with my foot, knew she was going to tell me to fix it tomorrow. I was waiting there for her to give me a pan of corn bread that she had made with my Sadie’s recipe. Waiting is a big part of a slave’s life, waiting and waiting to wait some more. Waiting for demands. Waiting for food. Waiting for the ends of days. Waiting for the just and deserved Christian reward at the end of it all.

Those white boys, Huck and Tom, watched me. They were always playing some kind of pretending game where I was either a villain or prey, but certainly their toy. They hopped about out there with the chiggers, mosquitoes and other biting bugs, but never made any progress toward me. It always pays to give white folks what they want, so I stepped into the yard and called out into the night,

“Who dat dere in da dark lak dat?”

They rustled clumsily about, giggled. Those boys couldn’t sneak up on a blind and deaf man while a band was playing. I would rather have been wasting time counting lightning bugs than bothering with them.

“I guess I jest gwyne set dese old bones down on dis heah porch and watch out for dat noise ’gin. Maybe dere be sum ol’ demon or witch out dere. I’m gwyne stay right heah where it be safe.” I sat on the top step and leaned back against the post. I was tired, so I closed my eyes.

The boys whispered excitedly to each other, and I could hear them, clear as a church bell.

“Is he ’sleep already?” Huck asked.

“I reckon so. I heard niggers can fall asleep jest like that,” Tom said and snapped his fingers.

“Shhhh,” Huck said.

“I say we ties him up,” Tom said. “Tie him up to dat porch post what he’s leaning ’ginst.”

“No,” said Huck. “What if’n he wakes up and makes a ruckus? Then I gets found out for being outside and not in bed like I’m supposed to be.”

“Okay. But you know what? I need me some candles. I’m gonna slip into Miss Watson’s kitchen and get me some.”

“What if’n you wake Jim?”

“I ain’t gonna wake nobody. Thunder can’t even wake a sleepin’ nigger. Don’t you know nuffin? Thunder, nor lightning, nor roarin’ lions. I hear tell of one that slept right through an earthquake.”

“What you suppose an earthquake feels like?” Huck asked.

“Like when you pa wakes you up in the middle of the night.”

The boys sneaked awkwardly, crawled knees over fists, and none too quietly across the complaining boards of the porch and inside through the Dutch door of Miss Watson’s kitchen. I heard them in there rifling about, opening cabinet doors and drawers. I kept my eyes closed and ignored a mosquito that landed on my arm.

“Here we go,” Tom said. “I gone jest take three.”

“You cain’t jest take an old lady’s candles,” Huck said. “That’s stealin’. What if’n they blamed Jim for that?”

“Here, I’ll leave her this here nickel. That’s more’n enough. They won’t ’spect no slave. Where a slave gonna git a nickel? Now, let’s git outta here befo’ she shows up.”

The boys stepped out onto the porch. I don’t imagine that they were hardly aware of all the noise they made.

“You shoulda left a note, too,” Huck said.

“No need for all that,” Tom said. “Nickel’s plenty.” I could feel the boys’ eyes turn to me. I remained still.

“What you doin’?” Huck asked.

“I’m gonna play a little joke on ol’ Jim.”

“You gonna wake him up is what you gonna do.”

“Hush up.”

Tom stepped behind me and grabbed my hat brim at my ears.

“Tom,” Huck complained.

“Shhhh.” Tom lifted my hat off my head. “I’s jest gonna hang this ol’ hat on this ol’ nail.”

“What’s that s’posed to do?” Huck asked.

“When he wakes up he’s gonna think a witch done it. I jest wish we could be round to see it.”

“Okay, it be on the nail, now let’s git,” Huck said.

Someone stirred inside the house and the boys took off running, turned the corner in a full gallop and kicked up dust. I could hear their footfalls fade.

Now someone was in the kitchen, at the door. “Jim?” It was Miss Watson.

“Yessum?”

“Was you ’sleep?”

“No, ma’am. I is a might tired, but I ain’t been ’sleep.”

“Was you in my kitchen?”

“No, ma’am.”

“Was anybody in my kitchen?”

“Not that I seen, ma’am.” That was quite actually true, as my eyes had been closed the whole time. “I ain’t seen nobody in yo kitchen.”

“Well, here’s that corn bread. You kin tell Sadie that I like her recipe. I made a couple of changes. You know, to refine it.”

“Yessum, I sho tell her.”

“You seen Huck about?” she asked.

“I seen him earlier.”

“How long ago?”

“A spell,” I said.

“Jim, I’m gonna ask you a question now. Have you been in Judge Thatcher’s library room?”

“In his what?”

“His library.”

“You mean dat room wif all dem books?”

“Yes.”

“No, missums. I seen dem books, but I ain’t been in da room. Why fo you be askin’ me dat?”

“Oh, he found some book off the shelves.”

I laughed. “What I gone do wif a book?”

She laughed, too.

**THE CORN BREAD** was wrapped in a thin towel and I had to keep shifting hands because it was hot. I considered having a taste because I was hungry, but I wanted Sadie and Elizabeth to have the first bites. When I stepped through the door, Lizzie ran to me, sniffing the air like a hound.

“What’s that I smell?” she asked.

“I imagine that would be this corn bread,” I said. “Miss Watson used your mama’s special recipe and it certainly does smell good. She did inform me that she made a couple of alterations.”

Sadie came to me and gave me a kiss on the mouth. She stroked my face. She was soft and her lips were soft, but her hands were as rough as mine from work in the fields, though still gentle.

“I’ll be sure to take this towel back to her tomorrow. White folks always remember things like that. I swear, I believe they set aside time every day to count towels and spoons and cups and such.”

“That’s the honest truth. Remember that time I forgot to put that rake back in the shed?”

Sadie had the corn bread on the block—a stump, really—that served as our table. She sliced into it. She handed portions to Lizzie and me. I took a bite and so did Lizzie. We looked at each other.

“But it smells so good,” the child said.

Sadie shaved off a sliver and put it in her mouth. “I swear that woman has a talent for not cooking.”

“Do I have to eat it?” Lizzie asked.

“No, you don’t,” Sadie said.

“But what are you going to say when she asks you about it?” I asked.

Lizzie cleared her throat. “Miss Watson, dat sum conebread lak I neva before et.”

“Try ‘dat be,’ ” I said. “That would be the correct incorrect grammar.”

“Dat be sum of conebread lak neva I et,” she said.

“Very good,” I said.

Albert appeared at the door of our shack. “James, you coming out?”

“I’ll be there directly. Sadie, do you mind?”

“Go on,” she said.

**I WALKED OUTSIDE** and over to the big fire, where the men were sitting. I was greeted and then I sat. We talked some about what happened to a runaway over at another farm. “Yeah, they beat him real good,” Doris said. Doris was a man, but that didn’t seem to matter to the slavers when they named him.

“All of them are going to hell,” Old Luke said.

“What happened to you today?” Doris asked me.

“Nothing.”

“Something must have happened,” Albert said.

They were waiting for me to tell them a story. I was apparently good at that, telling stories. “Nothing, except I got carried off to New Orleans today. Aside from that, nothing happened.”

“You what?” Albert said.

“Yes. You see, I thought I was drifting off into a nice nap about noon and the next thing I knew I was standing on a bustling street with mule-drawn carriages and whatnot all around me.”

“You’re crazy,” someone said.

I caught sight of Albert giving me the warning sign that white folks were close. Then I heard the clumsy action in the bushes and I knew it was those boys.

“Lak I say, I furst found my hat up on a nail. ‘I ain’t put dat dere,’ I say to mysef. ‘How dat hat git dere?’ And I knew ’twas witches what done it. I ain’t seen ’em, but it was dem. And one dem witches, the one what took my hat, she sent me all da way down to N’Orlins. Can you believe dat?” My change in diction alerted the rest to the white boys’ presence. So, my performance for the boys became a frame for my story. My story became less of a tale as the real game became the display for the boys.

“You don’t says,” Doris said. “Dem witches ain’t to be messed wif.”

“You got dat right,” another man said.

We could hear the boys giggling. “So, dere I was in N’Orlins and guess what?” I said. “All of a sudden dis root doctor come up behind me. He say, ‘Whatchu doin’ in dis here town.’ I tells him I ain’t got no idea how I git dere. And you know what he say ta me? You know what he say?”

“What he say, Jim?” Albert asked.

“He say I, Jim, be a free man. He say dat ain’t nobody gone call me no nigga eber ’gin.”

“Lawd, hab mercy,” Skinny, the farrier, shouted out.

“Demon say I could buy me what I want up da street. He say I could have me some whisky, if’n I wanted. Whatchu think ’bout that?”

“Whisky is the devil’s drink,” Doris said.

“Din’t matter,” I said. “Din’t matter a bit. He say I could hab it if’n I wanted it. Anything else, too. Din’t matter, though.”

“Why was dat?” a man asked.

“Furst, ’cause I was in dat place to whar dat demon sent me. Weren’t real, jest a dream. And ’cause I ain’t had me no money. It be dat simple. So dat demon snapped his old dirty fingas and sent me home.”

“Why fo he do dat?” Albert asked.

“Hell, man, you cain’t get in no trouble in N’Orlins lessen you gots some money, dream or no dream,” I said.

The men laughed. “Dat sho is what I heared,” a man said.

“Wait,” I said. “I thinks I hears one dem demons in the bushes right naw. Somebody gives me a torch so I kin set dis brush alight. Witches and demons don’t lak no fires burnin’ all round ’em. Dey start to melt lak butta on a griddle.”

We all laughed as we heard the white boys hightail it out of there.

**AFTER STEPPING ON** them squeaking boards last night, I knew Miss Watson would have me nailing down those planks and fixing that loose step. I waited till midmorning so I wouldn’t wake any white folks. They could sleep like nobody’s business and always complained to wake up too early, no matter how late it was.

Huck came out of the house and watched me for a few minutes. He hovered around like he did when something was on his mind.

“Why you ain’t out runnin’ wif yo friend?” I asked.

“You mean Tom Sawyer?”

“I guessin’ dat da one.”

“He’s probably still sleepin’. He was probably up all night robbin’ banks and trains and such.”

“He do dat, do he?”

“Claims to. He got some money, so he buys himself books and be readin’ all the time ’bout adventures. Sometimes I ain’t so sho ’bout him.”

“Whatchu mean?”

“Like, he found this cave and we goes into it and have a meeting with some other boys, but we get in there it’s like he gotta be the boss.”

“Yeah?”

“And all because he been reading them books.”

“And dat sorta rub you da wrong way?” I asked.

“Why people say that? ‘Rubbing the wrong way’?”

“Well, the way I sees it, Huck, is if’n you rake a fish’s back wid a fork head ta tail, ain’t gone matter much to him, but if’n you go ta other way…”

“I git it.”

“It seem sumtimes you jest gotta put up wif your friends. Dey gonna do what dey gonna do.”

“Jim, you work the mules and you fix the wagon wheels and now you fixin’ this here porch. Who taught you to do all them things?”

I stopped and looked at the hammer in my hand, flipped it. “Dat be a good question, Huck.”

“So, who did?”

“Necessity.”

“What?”

“ ’Cessity,” I corrected myself. “ ’Cessity is when you gots to do sumptin’ or else.”

“Or else what?”

“Else’n they takes you to the post and whips ya or they drags ya down to the river and sells ya. Nuffin you gots to worry ’bout.”

Huck looked at the sky. He pondered on that a bit. “Sho is pretty when you jest look at the sky with nothin’ in it, jest blue. I heard tell there are names for different blues. And reds and the like. I wonder what you call that blue.”

“ ‘Robin’s egg,’ ” I said. “You ever seen a robin’s egg?”

“You right, Jim. It is like a robin’s egg, ’ceptin’ it ain’t got the speckles.”

I nodded. “Dat be why you gots to look past the speckles.”

“Robin’s egg,” Huck said, again.

We sat there a little longer. “What else be eatin’ you?” I asked.

“I think Miss Watson is crazy.”

I didn’t say anything.

“Always talkin’ ’bout Jesus and prayers and such. She got Jesus Christ on the brain. She told me that prayers is to help me act selflessly in the world. What the hell does that mean?”

“Don’t be swearin’ naw, Huck.”

“You sound like her. I don’t see no profit in askin’ for stuff just so I don’t get it and learn a lesson ’bout not gettin’ what I asked fer. What kinda sense does that make? Might as well pray to that board there.”

I nodded.

“You noddin’ that it makes sense or don’t make no sense?”

“I’m jest noddin’, Huck.”

“I’m surrounded by crazy people. You know what Tom Sawyer did?”

“Tells me, Huck.”

“He made us take an oath in blood that if’n any of us tells gang secrets, then we will kill that person’s entire family. Don’t that sound crazy?”

“How you take a blood oath?” I asked.

“You’re supposed to cut yer hand open with a knife and shake with everybody else what done the same thing. You know, so your blood gets all mixed and mashed together. Then you’re blood brothers.”

I looked at his hands.

“We used spit instead. Tom Sawyer said it would do the same thing and how could we rob a bank wif our hands all cut up. One boy cried and said he was going to tell and Tom Sawyer shut him up wif a nickel.”

“Ain’t you tellin’ me yo secrets right naw?” I asked.

Huck paused. “You’re different.”

“ ’Cause I’m a slave?”

“No, taint that.”

“What it is, den?”

“You’re my friend, Jim.”

“Why, thank ya, Huck.”

“You won’t tell nobody, will ya?” He stared anxiously at me. “Even if we go out and rob us a bank. You won’t tell, right?”

“I kin keep me a secret, Huck. I kin keep yo secret, too.”

Miss Watson came to the back screen and hissed, “Ain’t you done with that step yet, Jim?”

“Matter fact, I am, Miss Watson,” I said.

“It’s a miracle with this here boy yakking your ear off. Huckleberry, you get back in this house and make yer bed.”

“I’m jest gonna mess it up agin tonight,” Huck said. He shoved his hands in his britches and swayed there, like he knew he’d just crossed a line.

“Don’t make me come out there,” she said.

“See ya later, Jim.” Huck ran into the house, running by Miss Watson sideways like he was dodging a swat.

“Jim,” Miss Watson said, looking back into the house after Huck.

“Ma’am?”

“I hear tell Huck’s pappy is back in town.” She stepped past me and looked at the road.

I nodded. “Yessum.”

“Keep an eye on Huck,” she said.

I didn’t know exactly what she was asking me to do. “Yessum.” I put the hammer back in the box. “Ma’am, what I s’posed to keep my eye on, zackly?”

“And help him watch out for that Sawyer boy.”

“Why fo you tellin’ me all dis, missum?”

The old woman looked at me and then out at the road and then up at the sky. “I don’t know, Jim.”

I studied on Miss Watson’s words. That Tom Sawyer wasn’t really a danger to Huck, just a kind of little fellow sitting on his shoulder whispering nonsense. But his father being back, that was a different story. That man might have been sober or he might have been drunk, but in either of those conditions he consistently threw beatings onto the poor boy.

## Chapter 2


T**HAT EVENING** I sat down with Lizzie and six other children in our cabin and gave a language lesson. These were indispensable. Safe movement through the world depended on mastery of language, fluency. The young ones sat on the packed-dirt floor and I was on one of our two homemade stools. The hole in the roof pulled the smoke from the fire that burned in the middle of the shack.

“Papa, why do we have to learn this?”

“White folks expect us to sound a certain way and it can only help if we don’t disappoint them,” I said. “The only ones who suffer when they are made to feel inferior is us. Perhaps I should say ‘when they don’t feel superior.’ So, let’s pause to review some of the basics.”

“Don’t make eye contact,” a boy said.

“Right, Virgil.”

“Never speak first,” a girl said.

“That’s correct, February,” I said.

Lizzie looked at the other children and then back to me. “Never address any subject directly when talking to another slave,” she said.

“What do we call that?” I asked.

Together they said, “Signifying.”

“Excellent.” They were happy with themselves, and I let that feeling linger. “Let’s try some situational translations. Something extreme first. You’re walking down the street and you see that Mrs. Holiday’s kitchen is on fire. She’s standing in her yard, her back to her house, unaware. How do you tell her?”

“Fire, fire,” January said.

“Direct. And that’s almost correct,” I said.

The youngest of them, lean and tall five-year-old Rachel, said, “Lawdy, missum\! Looky dere.”

“Perfect,” I said. “Why is that correct?”

Lizzie raised her hand. “Because we must let the whites be the ones who name the trouble.”

“And why is that?” I asked.

February said, “Because they need to know everything before us. Because they need to name everything.”

“Good, good. You all are really sharp today. Okay, let’s imagine now that it’s a grease fire. She’s left bacon unattended on the stove. Mrs. Holiday is about to throw water on it. What do you say? Rachel?”

Rachel paused. “Missums, that water gone make it wurs\!”

“Of course, that’s true, but what’s the problem with that?”

Virgil said, “You’re telling her she’s doing the wrong thing.”

I nodded. “So, what should you say?”

Lizzie looked at the ceiling and spoke while thinking it through. “Would you like for me to get some sand?”

“Correct approach, but you didn’t translate it.”

She nodded. “Oh, Lawd, missums ma’am, you wan fo me to gets some sand?”

“Good.”

“ ‘Gets some’ is hard to say.” This from Glory, the oldest child. “The *s*’s.”

“That’s true,” I said. “And it’s okay to trip over it. In fact, it’s good. You wan fo me to ge-gets s-s-some s-sand, Missum Holiday?”

“What if they don’t understand?” Lizzie asked.

“That’s okay. Let them work to understand you. Mumble sometimes so they can have the satisfaction of telling you not to mumble. They enjoy the correction and thinking you’re stupid. Remember, the more they choose to not want to listen, the more we can say to one another around them.”

“Why did God set it up like this?” Rachel asked. “With them as masters and us as slaves?”

“There is no God, child. There’s religion but there’s no God of theirs. Their religion tells that we will get our reward in the end. However, it apparently doesn’t say anything about their punishment. But when we’re around them, we believe in God. Oh, Lawdy Lawd, we’s be believin’. Religion is just a controlling tool they employ and adhere to when convenient.”

“There must be something,” Virgil said.

“I’m sorry, Virgil. You might be right. There might be some higher power, children, but it’s not their white God. However, the more you talk about God and Jesus and heaven and hell, the better they feel.”

The children said together, “And the better they feel, the safer we are.”

“February, translate that.”

“Da mo’ betta dey feels, da mo’ safer we be.”

“Nice.”

**HUCK CAUGHT ME** as I was hauling sacks of chicken feed from the buckboard to the shed in the back of the Widow Douglas’s house. He was studying on something intently and I could tell he wanted to talk.

“What be on yo mind, Huck?”

“Prayers,” he said. “Do you pray?”

“Yessir, I prays all the time.”

“What do you pray fer?” he asked.

“I prays for all sorta things. I pray once that the lil’ girl February would get better when she be sick.”

“Did it work?”

“Well, she be better now.” I sat on the buckboard and looked at the sky. “I pray fer rain once.”

“Did it work that time?”

“It did rain, sho nuff. Not right away, but ’ventually.”

“Then how you know God done it?”

“Reckon I don’t. But don’t God do everything? Who else make it rain?”

Huck picked up a rock, studied it in his hand for a bit, then hurled it at a squirrel high on an elm branch.

“Wanna know what I thinks?”

Huck looked at me.

“I thinks praying is for the people round you what wants you to pray. Pray so Miss Watson and Widow Douglas hears you and ask Jesus for what you knows dey wants. Make yer life a sight easier.”

“Maybe.”

“Ever’ now and den toss in something like a new fishin’ pole or like dat so they can scold you.”

Huck nodded. “That makes sense. Jim, you believe in God?”

“Why, sho nuff I does. If dere ain’t no God, den how we get this here wonderful life? Naw, you run on and play.”

I watched as Huck ran on down the street and turned out of sight around the corner in front of Judge Thatcher’s big house. Old Luke came up behind me as I was about to hoist the last sack up on my shoulder.

“You startled me,” I said.

“Sorry about that.” He hopped up and sat his short body on the wagon bed. “What did that little peckerhead want?”

“That boy’s all right,” I said. “He’s just trying to figure things out. Like the rest of us, I guess.”

“Have you heard about that McIntosh brother down in St. Louis?”

I shook my head.

“Free man. Light like you. He got himself into a scuffle at the docks and the police came and got him. He asked what they were going to do to him for fighting. One of the police said they were probably going to hang him. The brother believed him. Why wouldn’t he? He pulled out his knife and cut them both.”

A white man walked up and for some reason studied the horse hitched to the wagon. Luke stopped talking. We tried to not make eye contact with the man. We had been talking, so we had to keep talking.

“Go on,” I said to Luke.

“Okee. So, blue gum monkey on up da alley jes lak Lucifer done bit on da broomstick. And dem charlies be down on him like white on rice. I means dey be on ’em lak dem bubbles on soap.”

I nodded.

“Hey,” the white man shouted.

“Suh?” I said.

“This here horse belong to Miss Watson?”

“Naw, suh. The buckboard be belonging to Miss Watson. Da horse be dat of Wida Douglas.”

“You think she wanna sell him?”

“I wouldn’t know dat, suh.”

“You ask her when you see her,” he said.

“Yessuh, I sho will.”

The man looked at the horse one more time, spread the animal’s lips with his fingers and then walked away.

“What do you suppose a fool like that wants with a horse? He doesn’t know anything about horses,” Luke said.

“This creature is hundred years old and can barely pull this wagon when it’s dry and empty.”

“White people love to buy stuff,” Luke said.

“So, what happened to McIntosh?” I asked.

“They caught up to him and chained him to an oak tree, piled sticks under him and burned him alive. I heard he screamed for somebody to shoot him. Men yelled they’d shoot the first person who tried to save him from his misery.”

I felt sick to my stomach, but it wasn’t so different from many stories I’d heard. Still the day felt hotter and I realized how sticky with sweat I was. “A terrible way to die,” I said.

“I suppose there’s no good way,” Luke said.

“I don’t know about that.”

“What do you mean?” Luke asked.

“I mean, we are going to die. Maybe all ways to die aren’t bad. Maybe there’s a way to die that will satisfy me.”

“You’re talking crazy.”

I laughed.

Luke shook his head. “That wasn’t the worst part. Colored people die every day; you know that. The worst part was that the judge told the grand jury that it was an act of a multitude and so they couldn’t recommend any indictments. So, if enough people do it, it’s not a crime.”

“Good Lord,” I said. “Slavery.”

“Got that right,” Luke said. “If enough of them kill you, they’re innocent. Guess what the judge’s name was.”

I waited.

“ ‘Lawless.’ ”

“Do you think we’ll ever get to go to someplace like St. Louis or New Orleans?” I asked him.

“When we’s gets to heaben,” he said and winked.

We started to laugh and then we spotted a white man up the road. There was nothing that irritated white men more than a couple of slaves laughing. I suspected they were afraid we were laughing at them or else they simply hated the idea of us having a good time. Whatever the case, we were slow to hush and so captured his attention. He’d heard us and walked our way.

“What you boys gigglin’ like little girls ’bout?” he asked.

I’d seen the man before, but I didn’t know him. He tried to strike a pose like a dangerous man. That made me more and less afraid of him.

“We was wonderin’ if’n it be true?” Luke said.

“What be true?” the man asked.

“We be’s wonderin’ if’n dem streets in New Orleans really is made a gol, lak dey say,” Luke said and looked at me.

“And if’n it be true dat when it flood, it flood da streets with whisky. I ain’t never tasted no whisky, nosuh, but it sho nuff look good.” I turned to Luke. “Don’t it look good ta you, Luke?”

It was at this point that I imagined, for a second, that he saw we were making fun of him, but he laughed big and said, “It looks good ’cause it is good, boys.” He walked away howling.

“He’s going to get drunk now, not so much because he can, but because we can’t,” I said.

Luke chuckled. “So, when we see him staggering around later acting the fool, will that be an example of proleptic irony or dramatic irony?”

“Could be both.”

“Now that would be ironic.”

## Chapter 3


T**HE SPRING SNOW** caught everybody by surprise. Miss Watson had me chopping wood all day, so that she could have enough for weeks. But there wasn’t much and she wasn’t suggesting that I or any other slave might take some home. We collected what we could from the ground and secretly felled some small trees near the quarters. That wood was, of course, green and smoked terribly and was hard to keep going, but it gave some heat. I managed to stash some seasoned logs under Miss Watson’s porch. I would return for them in the night. The old slaves April and Cotton needed them. Some folks might have called what I was doing stealing. So would I, and I didn’t particularly care. I had worked up a sweat and had my shirt off, even though it was cold.

“That’s a lot of wood,” Huck said. He startled me. “Did I scare you?” he asked.

“A lil’ bit, I s’pose. Where you comin’ from?”

“I just sold all my worldly possessions to Judge Thatcher. He give me this here dollar fer all of it.”

I whistled. “A whole dollar. I din’t know you had so much.”

I split some more wood and caught Huck staring at me.

“How you be lakin’ school?”

“I reckon you kin say I’m getting used to it.”

“I wouldn’t mind me sum learnin’.” I split a couple more logs.

“You know, you ain’t much darker ’n me.”

“I be dark nuff.”

“How come you’re a slave?”

“ ’Cause my mama was one.”

“What about your pa?” he asked.

“Prolly not. But it don’ matter. If’n dey know one o’ yo kin colored, den you colored. Don’ matter what you looks lak.”

“I seen some tracks in the snow,” Huck said.

“I s’pect dere be lotta tracks in da snow. Dat be where folks leaves ’em.”

“One of them tracks had a cross in the heel.”

“Whatchu mean, cross?”

“You know, like Jesus—that kinda cross.”

“I wouldn’t study on dat too much,” I said. I didn’t like seeing the boy troubled like that. I knew what he was thinking.

“So, you think it’s him, too.” He was talking about his father. “You think he’s back, too.”

“I din’t say dat.”

“But you thought it. I could tell that you thought it. What does he want, Jim? You know stuff.”

I reached into my pocket and pulled out a ball of hair from a mule’s tail that I always saved for those white children. “You know what dis here be?” I held it up so that the sunlight caught it.

“What?”

“It be a hairball from da belly of an ox. You know what dat make it?”

The boy shook his head. “Magic,” I told him. “Dis here hairball be magic and it can talk ta me.”

“What does it say?”

I put the ball up to my ear. “Yeah, I hears it. It be talkin’. It say your pappy gots two angels what folla him round in dis world, one dem black and da other one white. They be telling him different things. One be bad and one be good and da man don’ know what one will win out. He don’ know what he gwyne to do. Leave or stay. This here ball s’posed to know, but it don’t.”

“That don’t help none.”

“Wait, da ball talkin’ ’gin.”

Huck tried to listen with me.

“Yeah, yeah. It say you gone be awright. You gonna git hurt and den you gonna be awright. Dere be two womens hangin’ round you. You gonna marry yersef a poor woman and den a rich ’un. But whateber you does, stay way from da water. That riber be da death of you.”

“It say all that?”

I nodded. “It be sleepin’ naw.”

Miss Watson came to the door. “Huck,” she called, “get in here and wash up for supper.” She looked at me. “Boy, ain’t you done with that wood yet?”

“Be a mess of it, missums.”

“Well, stop now ’cause it’s too loud. My head hurts.”

“Yessum.”

* * *

**LUKE CAUGHT UP** to me as I was walking home. “Slow down so an old man can keep up,” he said.

We walked quietly for a while. I knew I was being extra quiet, but I couldn’t help it. I kicked at a rock.

“What are you fretting over?” Luke asked.

“Nothing,” I said.

“Are you worried about the logs you stashed under the porch?”

“You saw those?”

“I did.”

“No, I’m not worried about the wood.”

“You worried about that boy,” Luke said. When I looked at him, he said, “Huck. That boy, Huck.”

“Well, he’s got a drunkard father that won’t leave him alone.”

“What’s that to you? That’s white people’s business.”

I nodded. “He’s still a child.”

“Yeah, a free child.” He pointed at me. “There is something about that boy. Something about you and him.”

“He’s got a heap of trouble,” I said. “Sad as that may be, I’m still a slave and I can’t help him at all.”

## Chapter 4


T**HE WEATHER REMAINED** unseasonably cold and I found myself pilfering wood for not only April and Cotton, but also my family and a couple of others. I was terribly concerned that the wood might be missed, and that fear worked its way into reality one Sunday afternoon. Sadie came to me.

“What’s the matter?” I asked.

She peeked out the shack door, looked at the nine-year-old and then at me. “What are you going to do?” she asked.

“What are you talking about?”

“I heard Miss Watson talking to Judge Thatcher.”

“Yes?”

Sadie sniffed.

I put my arm around her. “Settle down.”

Nothing could have prepared me for what she said next. She said, “Miss Watson told Judge Thatcher that she was going to sell you to a man in New Orleans.”

“What’s that mean?” Lizzie asked. “Papa, what does that mean?”

I walked to the door and looked out.

“Jim?” Sadie said.

“Papa?”

“Did she say all of us or only me?” I asked.

“Just you, Jim,” she cried. “What are we going to do? They’re going to split us up and we won’t know where you are.”

“What?” Lizzie gasped.

“No, they’re not,” I said. I grabbed a big rag and laid it out.

“What are you doing?” Sadie asked.

I put bread and dried meat on the cloth and folded it up. “They can’t sell me if they don’t have me.”

“You can’t run,” Sadie said. “You know what they do to runaways.”

“I’ll hide out. I’ll hide out on Jackson Island. They’ll think I’ve run north, but I’ll be here. Then I’ll figure out something.”

“You can’t do that. They’ll find you for sure. Then they’ll treat you like a runaway. They might even—” She stopped.

“Even what?” Lizzie asked.

“Well, I’m going to go out there until I can figure out what to do,” I said. I took a knee and looked at Lizzie, held her tight. “Listen, everything is going to be all right. Okay, do you hear me, sweetie?”

She cried.

I stood and kissed Sadie. “Don’t tell anyone where I’ve gone. You can’t even tell Luke.”

“Okay.”

“Did you hear that, Lizzie?” I said.

“Yes, Papa.”

I moved toward the door.

“Papa?”

“I’m okay, baby.” I felt Sadie’s hand land on my shoulder. I kissed her. “I’ll come back for you.”

I left my family and slipped into the woods. It was perhaps stupid to attempt escape during the light of day, but I didn’t know when they might come for me. I didn’t run. Running was something a slave could never do, unless, of course, he was running. No one noticed as I passed through the Widow Douglas’s backyard and down the steep hill to the river. I waited there against an undercut bank. I couldn’t venture out onto the water during the day. Too many ferries and riverboats and folks fishing along the shore. I was as much scared as angry, but where does a slave put anger? We could be angry with one another; we were human. But the real source of our rage had to go without address, swallowed, repressed. They were going to rip my family apart and send me to New Orleans, where I would be even farther from freedom and would probably never see my family again.

* * *

—

**AT DUSK** I was eaten alive by mosquitoes. I pulled a log from the bank and slid it into the frigid, muddy water. I pushed off and kicked my way straight across, knowing that the strong current of the Mississippi would suck me downstream. I could just barely see the island in the dark and I hoped I wouldn’t glide right past it. Luckily, no riverboats ever navigated the channel between the shore and the island. But I couldn’t be sure some peckerwood wouldn’t paddle by in a canoe or on a raft.

I could finally see the island, but I felt a tugging on my leg. I couldn’t shake loose of the snag. I didn’t believe in river monsters, so I quickly figured I’d gotten hung up in somebody’s trotline. Getting untangled was difficult, and for a brief time I thought I was going to miss the island or drown or both. It, however, turned out to be good fortune. When I yanked the line free of its tether, I pulled with it three large catfish that I could eat that night, which was good because my bread was ruined. Also, I could reuse the line and the hooks. This thinking was good because it distracted me from just how exhausted I was. I hit the rocky beach of the island and lay on my back, the fish on my chest. It was the fish smell that woke me. As my exhaustion wore off, I began to shiver uncontrollably. I was freezing, but there was nothing I could do about that. I wrestled out of my soaked rag of a coat and my clothes. I took my little knife from my pocket and gutted the catch. I cut off the heads and discarded them because I could not stomach their faces. I couldn’t risk a fire in the darkness. I would cook them and eat in the morning. I had to get myself dry and warm and find some sleep. I moved into the trees, out of the wind, and buried myself in fallen leaves. I put my wet coat on top of the plant matter and closed my eyes. The weight of the garment at least made me imagine that I was warmer.

* * *

—

**MORNING CAME AND I** crawled into my drier, but frozen, clothes. The coat was still wet, so I laid it over a bush. I hopped around to get warm, waiting for the sun to get high enough for me to use my piece of glass to start a fire. I heard rustling in the trees. It sounded like a human, so I had to assume it was a white human.

“What dere be in dem woods? Dat be a ghost? You stays away from me, you ol’ shade.”

“Jim? Is that you, Jim?” It was Huck.

“I swear, you lak to scared me to def.”

“What you doin’ out here?” the boy asked.

“Furst off, I’m freezin’,” I said. “What you be doin’ on dis ilan? And why you got blood all ova ya?”

“I kilt myself,” the boy said.

I looked him over. “You din’t do a good job.”

“Well, Miss Watson, that damn judge and Pap think I’m dead and that’s all that matters. They think I was murdered.”

“Why dey think dat?” I asked.

“I kilt a pig and spread his blood all round Pap’s cabin. I made a mess like there had been a fight in there.”

In my head I was doing the math. Huck was supposedly murdered and I’d just run away. Who did I think they would suspect of the heinous crime?

“But what you doin’ out here, Jim?”

“I be hidin’.”

“Why?”

“Well, I be hidin’ causin’ Miss Watson got a notion to sell me down the riber. And now…” I shook my head.

“And now what?”

“And now causin’ I kilt you. Least dat what dey gone think.” I looked at his eyes. “You needs to go back.”

“I cain’t,” Huck said. “Pap will kill me for sure.”

“I reckon dat’s tru nuff.” I looked through the trees at the channel we’d crossed. “Lawd, hab mercy.”

“What’s your plan, Jim?”

“I was gonna live out heah on dis here ilan for a spell, but naw dey lookin’ fer a killa and a body.”

“What you mean, Miss Watson gonna sell you down the river?”

“I be a slave, Huck. She kin sell me if she want. And ’parently, she want. I had to run fo’ she done it.”

“But you got a family.”

“Don’ mean nuffin if’n you a slave.”

Huck sat and studied on that.

The sun was up and slicing the trees, burning off a bit of the chill. I pointed to the catfish. “Leaseways we got breakfast,” I said. “You got matches?”

“No.”

“Den I use my magic glass,” I said. I took the round bottom of some bottle I’d found a long time ago from my pocket.

“Magic?”

“Magic,” I repeated. “It take light from da sun and mixes it round and gits all narrow and turns inta fire.”

I moved us to a small clearing and used the glass and got some kindling of dry moss started and let the boy add sticks. A couple of logs later and we had it going nicely. The fire felt good. It probably was a bad idea, but we didn’t peel the skin off the last fish.

“I got some bread,” Huck said.

“I lost mine in da water. I figger my jerky gone dry out okay.” I looked at the fish. “I reckon dat skin gone burn ’way, awright.”

“Pap jest eats the skin.”

“Hmmm.”

I watched the smoke rise. It seemed to disperse pretty well before it reached the treetops.

Huck enjoyed the fish. “How did you catch ’em?”

“Din’t really,” I said. “I gots snagged in sumbuddy’s trotline and dey was already caught.”

“Lucky,” he said.

I nodded.

“I cain’t believe Miss Watson gone sell you. I mean, she likes you.”

“I reckon she likes money mo’. Mos’ peoples likes money mo’ ’n anythin’ else. White folks, anyways.”

“Not me,” Huck said. “I told the judge to take all that money I found.”

“How much you reckon it be?”

“Thousands,” Huck said. “Money ain’t nothing but trouble. Don’t you think, Jim?”

“I woodn’t know. Ain’t never had no money.”

Huck nodded.

We heard a boom and lay flat on the ground. We crawled to the edge of the trees and saw a ferryboat passing by. Judge Thatcher and his daughter, Bessie, were aft. Tom Sawyer’s aunt Polly was leaning over the side. A man I’d never seen was readying a small cannon to fire another shot. He lit the fuse and cracked the air with another boom. The ball splashed into the water.

“Why they doin’ that, Jim?”

“Dey’s tryin’ to get yo dead body to float up to the top o’ da water.”

“Be funny if some other body float up,” he said.

“Hilarious,” I said.

“What?” He looked at me.

“I say da ‘he harry us.’ ”

“What’s that mean?”

“What? Looky naw,” I said.

The boy turned back and we watched the man at the bow float something into the water. I was relieved to be able to redirect his attention. In all my life that was the first time I had ever had a language slip. That had to be an indication of just how addled and agitated I was.

“What’s that?” Huck asked.

“I reckon dat be a loaf a bread wif the quicksilva in it.”

“What’s that do?”

“It s’posed to find it way to a corpse.”

“Does that work?”

“White folk believe all sorts a stuff I don’t know about. Dey is the stupidstitiousest people in da world.”

“You mean ‘superstitious.’ ”

“Dat what I say.” We watched the ferryboat disappear around the bend. “They sho’ nuff thinks you dead.” As I said it, that wave of fear washed over me again. I might have been better off drowning in the river or freezing to death in the night. One thing was certain: I had to make sure Huck didn’t become the corpse they were looking for. More to the point, I had to make certain I didn’t become the corpse they were looking for.

## Chapter 5


W**E RAN A TROTLINE** across a little cove and so had plenty of catfish to eat, even the occasional crappie. We also found plenty of blackberries and gooseberries. The gooseberries were sour, but mixed with the blackberries and currants, they were quite good. The weather improved and we were living well enough that I wondered if Sadie and Lizzie and I could survive out there. But we would have to be running like fugitives, ducking and hiding. It was bad enough being a slave, but being fugitive slaves was worse. Being fugitive slaves hiding out under white people’s noses would be intolerable.

Huck seemed happy, though, feeling safe from his father. We found a big cave near the center of the island and were safe enough there to have fires at night.

“Jim,” the boy said one night, “why do you think my pappy hates me so?”

“Reckon I don’ know, Huck. Whatchu think?”

“I know he don’t like my head.”

“What?”

“Well, my hairline. He don’t like it. He’s always grabbing me and he pulls back my hair and then slaps me.”

“Hmmmph.”

“Tells me I gots a widow’s peak. I didn’t even know what that was. Miss Watson told me when I asked and she said a lot of people got ’em. It’s when yer hair points like an arrow.” He pulled back his hair and showed me. “Heck, Jim, yer head does the same thing. Pull yer hair back.”

“It do?” I touched my hair. “I reckon it do. What you s’pose a wida’s peak mean? Is it good luck?”

“Sho ain’t for me,” Huck said.

After a spell of silence, I caught Huck staring at me.

“What?” I asked.

“Being a slave, you got to do whatever your owner say to do?”

“Whateber dey say,” I said. “Wheneber dey say. Dey say, ‘Jump,’ I say, ‘How high?’ Dey say, ‘Spit,’ I say, ‘How far?’ ”

“How kin one person own another person?”

“Dat be a good question, Huck.”

“Look what I found.” Huck showed me a length of snakeskin. He pushed it toward me, but I pulled away.

“Be bad luck to handle a snakeskin,” I said. “Snake might come back lookin’ fer his clothes.”

“Who’s superstitious now?”

“Dat ain’t stupesition, dat’s jest common sense.”

Huck laughed. “What superstitions you know, Jim?”

“Don’ walk under no ladder. I know dat one. Don’ believe it.”

“So, you would walk under a ladder.”

“Nossir. Ain’t safe to walk under no ladder, but it ain’t bad luck. Black cats s’posed to be bad. White cats okay, black cats bad.”

“What if’n you see an owl in the daytime?”

I was barely listening to him. I was worried about Sadie and Lizzie. “Owl?” I said. “Daytime? Lawdy, now dat dere is some bad bizness. Dat mean sumbuddy gonna meet his maker.” I could see my answer made him happy. “But dat don’ make me stuperstitious. Dat jest mean I gots mo’ good sense, lak I say.”

Huck laughed.

“Well, one thin’ fer sho? It gone rain like crazy tomorrow, so we best to stow some food and get ready to hunkers down.”

“Why you think it’s gonna rain?”

“Seen lots of hawks flyin’ round. Dey likes to hunt fo’ it rain. And seen ants buildin’ piles round dey holes.”

“How do they know it’s gonna rain?” the boy asked.

“Dey’s a part of nature and weather be a part of nature and dem parts talk to each other.”

“Ain’t people a part of nature?”

“If’n dey is, den dey ain’t no good part. Da rest o’ nature don’ hardly talk to no human peoples anymo. Maybe it try from time to time, but peoples don’ listen. Anyway, gone be a big rain.”

I watched as exhaustion came over Huck. His head dropped and he was asleep. I went out of the cave and collected lots of wood. We were going to have to keep the fire going. There would be no sun to use to start another one. I was serious about the rain. I could feel it in my joints.

* * *

—

**MY PREDICTION WAS NOT** only true, but turned out to be grossly understated. The rain was torrential, biblical. Our beach fairly disappeared. I managed to pull in our trotline, else it would have been lost for good. That a flood was coming was a foregone conclusion. The only question was how high. The river rose and rose, covering much of Jackson Island. Sheet lightning lit up the sky seconds at a time. Huck fretted that a twister might be coming, but I told him the winds were blowing in a rotation counter to such an event. What I said was “Dat wind be twistin’ optsite of a tornada.” It was nonsense, but it quieted the boy’s fear. Then he pointed.

I looked. A house was floating down the channel toward us. It was a frightening sight. It was late afternoon, dark with no sun, and so it was difficult to see, but it was as big as what it was. It hung up against some trees and Huck and I had the same idea. Provisions. We dragged Huck’s canoe from the cave to the water and paddled to the house. It was hard work. We tied the boat to a tree and climbed in through a smashed window. We waded through water inside the wrecked house, with clothes floating everywhere. It had settled at a severe angle so it was a bit of a climb to the kitchen cabinets. Huck opened one and squealed, ironically, like a pig, as he found a rasher of bacon. I turned and saw a boot between the stove and the wall, then it became clear the boot was at the end of a leg.

“What is it?” Huck asked.

“Take the bacon and get back in the canoe,” I said.

Huck froze and stared at me.

“Does lak I say\!”

I leaned over and got a good look at the man’s face. It was a white man, deader than dead. His face was twisted and ugly and dead. I looked at the face for a while, my hands trembling not because he was dead, but because I was there while he was dead. A dead white man. I studied the face. All white men looked alike in a way, like bears, like bees, especially when dead.

“Is he dead?” Huck asked.

“Get on back in dat boat\!”

“Who is it? You recognize him?”

“I ain’t know him. Naw git. You don’t need to see nuffin lak dat.”

“I ain’t no baby, Jim.”

“You nuff o’ one—naw let’s git outta heah. Grab some dem clothes and git out dat winda.”

While he was pulling garments into his arms I found a stack of papers wedged into the corner of a shelf. There was a bottle of ink. I pushed all of it into my trousers.

As we made it through the window and were trying to pull the canoe back to us, Huck asked me why I sounded so funny in the house.

“What you be talkin’ ’bout? Git dat boat. Dis here house about to tear ’way from dem trees.”

As soon as we had paddled away, the house did just that and roared by us.

“Woooweee,” Huck said. “Look at that.”

The house was quickly out of sight.

“Was he dead, Jim?”

“Yeah, he be dead.”

“Who was he?”

I didn’t say anything. I paddled us into the trees, and then we climbed out onto muddy ground.

“Who was he, Jim? I ain’t never seen a dead person before.”

“I ain’t neber seed him fo’.”

Back in our cave we listened to the storm. We might have heard lightning strike a tree. The thunder shook us hard. We chewed some bacon right off the rasher. It wasn’t delicious, but the longer we chewed it, the bigger it got, and so it satisfied our hunger.

“I wonder who he was,” Huck said.

“It be bad luck to study on dead folk,” I told him. “You already stackin’ dat bad luck after handlin’ dat snakeskin.”

“This bacon is awful,” Huck said.

“Sho nuff,” I said.

But we kept chewing.

“You heard the one ’bout not putting mirrors facing mirrors?” Huck asked. I looked at his young eyes and thought about Lizzie. I wondered just how scared she was for me at that moment, hated the idea of her feeling fear. I realized I hated it because I knew that feeling so well, every day, every night. I laughed to myself and I didn’t know why.

“What is it?” the boy asked.

I couldn’t use the word *irony* with him. “Sho be funny, ain’t it?”

“What?”

“Here we is chewin’ on dis terrbul bacon, me a runaway and you a dead boy. You know dey gone think I da one dat kilt you.”

“I never thought of that,” Huck said. “I never dreamed I could git you into trouble. Why would you want to kill me?”

“Dat don’t matter none to white folks.”

“I don’t like white folks,” he said. “And I is one.”

“Sho look lak one.”

Lightning lit up the outside at the cave’s mouth and then thunder shook us again. The storm was right on top of us. I had been right about the weather, but I hadn’t thought far enough ahead to remember that we might not be the only ones on the island trying to find a dry place. I reached back for another stick for the fire without looking and felt pain shoot through my hand. I screamed and jumped up.

“Jim,” Huck shouted.

The rattlesnake that had been attached to my hand fell off into the fire, but it managed to wriggle free across the ground and out into the rain.

“Did he get you?”

“ ’Fraid so.” I walked over to the mouth of the cave and dropped to my knees. I took out my knife and cut the bite, gave a good suck and spat out the blood. Then I slapped some of the clay mud on it. “Git dat rag ’n’ tie it round heah.”

“What’s this gonna do?” Huck asked.

“I’s hopin’ da mud will draw out the poison. Make it tight.”

“Do you think it will work?”

“At least one of us gone know in da moanin’.”

## Chapter 6


M**Y FACE FELT FAT** and numb and my hands and feet were without feeling, but where I was bitten was extremely painful. I felt weaker than I’d ever felt. If I had had any real food in me I might have vomited. My head was spinning, the world was spinning, and I didn’t know if it was from the venom or from anxiety. I lay still, at first feeling the concerned stare of Huck, and then a spiraling into delirium, like down a whirlpool. I burned with fever, and the chills I was feeling were almost interesting. I saw Sadie and Lizzie. They stood on a little wooden dock, took vegetables from a little boat and piled them in big straw baskets. Then I was in Judge Thatcher’s library, a place where I had spent many afternoons while he was out at work or hunting ducks. I could see books in front of me. I had read them secretly, but this time, in this fever dream, I was able to read without fear of being discovered. I had wondered every time I sneaked in there what white people would do to a slave who had learned how to read. What would they do to a slave who had taught the other slaves to read? What would they do to a slave who knew what a hypotenuse was, what *irony* meant, how *retribution* was spelled? I was burning up with fever, fading in and out of consciousness, focusing and refocusing on Huck’s face.

François-Marie Arouet de Voltaire put a fat stick into the fire. His delicate fingers held the wood for what seemed like too long a time.

“I’m afraid there’s no more wood,” I said. “Which is fine, because I am hot enough. Too hot.”

He reached in again and moved some charred pieces around. He looked at his blackened fingertips. “I’m like you,” he said.

“How is that?”

He wiped his hands on his pants, left smudges. “You shouldn’t be a slave,” Voltaire said, sighing. He sat beside me, moved to feel my forehead with the back of his hand and then thought better. “Like Montesquieu, I think we are all equal, regardless of color, language or habit.”

“You do, do you?” I asked.

“However, you must realize that climate and geography can be significant factors in determining human development. It’s not that your features make you unequal, it’s that they are signs of biological differences, things that have helped you survive in those hot, desolate places. It’s those factors that stop you from achieving the more perfect human form found in Europe.”

“Is that right?”

“The African can be easily trained in the ways of the European, of course. He can come to be more than he naturally is, to learn those manners and skills that will allow him to become equal.”

“Yes?”

“That is what equality is, Jim. It’s the *capacity* for becoming equal. The same way a black man in Martinique can learn French and so become French, he can also acquire the skills of equality and so become equal. But I repeat myself.”

“I hate you,” I said through my fever and chills. “You realize, of course, that I have been bitten by a snake. Only to have you come to me in this delirium.”

“Well, yes, but all men are equal. That’s my point. But even you have to admit the presence of, shall we call him—it—the devil, in your African humans.” Voltaire adjusted his position and held his hands to the fire.

“You’re saying we’re equal, but also inferior,” I said.

“I’m detecting a disapproving tone,” he said. “Listen, my friend, I’m on your side. I’m against the institution of slavery. Slavery of any kind. You know that I am an abolitionist of the first order.”

“Thank you?”

“You’re welcome.”

“You do not believe that humans are inherently bad?” I asked.

“I do not. If they were, they would kill as soon as they could walk.”

“How do you explain slavery? Why are my people subjected to it, treated with such cruelty?”

Voltaire shrugged.

“Let me try this,” I said. “You have a notion, like Raynal, of natural liberties, and we all have them by virtue of our being human. But when those liberties are put under societal and cultural pressure, they become civil liberties, and those are contingent on hierarchy and situation. Am I close?”

Voltaire was scribbling on paper. “That was good, that was good. Say all of that again.”

“Jim? Jim?” It was Huck.

“Huckleberry?”

“You okay?”

The boy came into some focus. “I ain’t as hot as I was.” I glimpsed the mouth of the cave and saw daylight. “I guess Ima gone make it.”

“You sho talk funny in yer sleep.”

“I does?”

Huck nodded. He looked at me suspiciously.

“What I say?”

“Who is Raynal?”

I recalled some of my dream, wondered just how much talking I had done out loud. “He be a slave I knowed from way back.”

“What does *hierarchy *mean?”

“What?” I said. “Ain’t no such word.”

“You said it. And a lotta other words. You didn’t sound like you. Are you possessed, Jim?”

“Lawdy. I could be, I s’pose. Wouldn’t dat be sumptin’. A snake is da devil, ain’t he. I hopes he din’t put no demons in my blood.” I looked around the cave. “Where my lucky piece o’ glass.” I found the round glass and held it so the boy could see it. “My lucky glass will protect me.”

I was still weak and I used fondling the glass as an excuse to get away from Huck’s questions.

“You was sho talkin’ funny.”

“I’m habing dem chills ’gin.” And in fact I was.

“Here, drink some water.” Huck handed me the old can we’d been using for drinking.

“Thank ya, Huck.”

“I’ll go see if the storm ruined all the berries.”

“You do dat. Ima gonna sleep sum mo’. Watch out for dem snakes.”

As the boy disappeared into the bright light of the outside, I felt again how sick I was. I suspected at that moment that I would not die, but it was unclear whether I would be pleased about that fact. My head was swimming and I was in great pain. I was nauseated and still feverish. I tried to pull myself to my feet, but my limbs were numb and uncooperative. In truth, I was afraid to sleep again for fear of Huck coming back and hearing my thoughts without their passing through my slave filter. I was even more afraid of further unproductive, imagined conversations with Voltaire, Rousseau and Locke about slavery, race and, of all things, albinism. How strange a world, how strange an existence, that one’s equal must argue for one’s equality, that one’s equal must hold a station that allows airing of that argument, that one cannot make that argument for oneself, that premises of said argument must be vetted by those equals who do not agree.

My chills returned and I thought again that I might die. I broke into a sweat and lay still for another couple of hours until Huck returned.

“Jim, you okay?”

“I’s been betta.”

“I found some blackberries what weren’t ruined,” he said and unfolded a cloth to show me. “I put our trotline out, so we should have some fish tonight.”

“How big dat flood? Water go down?”

“Not that I kin see,” the boy said. “We’re a long way from the land now.”

“Water might be movin’ too fast to catch us dem catfish.”

“You look a lil’ better,” Huck said. He stirred the fire and put some sticks in to get it going again.

## Chapter 7


I** STAYED SICK** for a couple of days. My fever broke and slowly my appetite returned. A remarkable thing in itself, in that all we had to eat was catfish and berries. I finally ventured out to set a few traps for rabbits.

* * *

—

**AT LAST** we caught a rabbit and sat down to what felt like a real feast.

“I’m glad you didn’t die,” Huck said.

“Ima right pleased ’bout dat my own sef.” I stared into the fire. “Dyin’ can ruin a good time.”

“What is it, Jim?”

“I be worried ’bout my fambly,” I said. “I know dey be worried ’bout me. You gonna have to go see if’n dey awright.”

“I cain’t go there. I’m supposed to be dead.”

“Sho would help me some if’n you wasn’t,” I said. I looked at the clothes he’d taken in such a hurry from the washed-away house. “What if’n you wore dat dere dress and make lak you be a gurl?”

“I don’t look like no girl.”

“You would if’n you was in dat dress. You kin tie you hair back like dem white gurls does.”

“No.”

“I needs to know if’n my fambly’s okay.”

“I suppose I should find out what’s going on, too. What should my name be? My girl name.”

“Sumptin’ simple,” I said.

“What about ‘Mary’?”

“Dat a good name.”

“What about my last name? What about ‘McGillicuddy’?”

“Kin you spell it?”

Huck looked at his feet. “No.”

“Sumptin’ simple,” I said, again.

“ ‘Williams’?”

“Sho.”

Huck took his clothes off and put on the dress. His young face was effeminate enough that he might have been taken for a girl in passing. He wouldn’t bear a close look. His posture was all wrong.

“How do I look?” he asked.

“Stan’ up straight-lak and don’t hunch lak a bear.”

“Like this?”

I nodded.

“Why, I do declare,” he said in a falsetto that was actually lower than his speaking voice. “Lordy, but it’s hot in here.”

“You s’posed to be a gurl, not no ol’ woman.”

“This ain’t gone work,” the boy said.

“Sho it will.”

**THOUGH WEAK,** I helped Huck get the canoe from the cave to the river. The flood had receded considerably, but it was clear that the mainland had acquired a new contour. Because of this change it was difficult for us to know just where Huck should put ashore. We made a guess, but as Huck paddled out, it was clear that his hitting anywhere near our selected spot was hardly likely. I watched him for only a short time before I dragged myself back to the cave and the fire.

For the first time in my life, I had paper and ink. I was beside myself. I found a straight stick and shaved it to a point and scratched a groove on one side. I put the paper on my lap, dipped my stick into the ink and wrote the alphabet. I printed letters as I had seen them in books, slowly, clumsily. Then I wrote my first words. I wanted to be certain that they were mine and not some I had read from a book in the judge’s library. I wrote:
>  
> *I am called Jim. I have yet to choose a name.*

> *In the religious preachings of my white captors I am a victim of the Curse of Ham. The white so-called masters cannot embrace their cruelty and greed, but must look to that lying Dominican friar for religious justification. But I will not let this condition define me. I will not let myself, my mind, drown in fear and outrage. I will be outraged as a matter of course. But my interest is in how these marks that I am scratching on this page can mean anything at all. If they can have meaning, then life can have meaning, then I can have meaning.*

## Chapter 8


I** WAS HAPPY ENOUGH** to send Huckleberry off on his mission to the mainland. My pleasure in seeing him off was threefold. If he was unsuccessful and discovered, he might be accused of having helped me escape, rather than my being seen as a runaway. And I might no longer be suspected of his murder and/or kidnapping, the punishment for either being torture and death. Finally, if Huck was able to find his way back without detection, he could bring me much desired and needed news of my family’s condition.

I was proud of the way he used all the strength in his small body to paddle against the current. The morning fog was fairly burned away as he stood on the shore. He was just barely visible as he tied the boat to a tree and covered it with brush. He scrambled up the bank in his dress and was gone. I returned to the cave, ate some dried fish and fell into a nap, during which I did not dream.

* * *

—

**I KNEW FROM EXPERIENCE** that the snake bite was not likely to kill me. My main concern was the site of the bite—the wound, not the venom. The twin punctures had scabbed over and there was no puffiness. That relief allowed me to sleep. That I could sleep so much was slightly alarming, but I continued to improve. I felt stronger every time I awoke. Strong enough to become impatient. I collected wood and kept the fire going. I collected catfish from the trotline, ate some and hung strips over the smoke to dry. I imagined that I would be running through back country, with or without Huck, for some time. I became nervous and vigilant after the second day. I pulled more tree limbs up to conceal the cave and fashioned a place to sit from which I could look out. Not that I had any idea what I might do if I spotted anyone’s approach. The boy had the canoe, so I spent some hours tying together branches, not quite a proper raft. A proper raft would need constructing near the water’s edge, and I couldn’t chance that.

I considered the notion of telling Huckleberry that the body I had seen in that flooded house was his Pap. I imagined that the knowledge might allow him to feel safe again in the house of Miss Watson. To tell the truth, I didn’t know why I had kept it to myself. Perhaps, fearful of him or not, I had some concern that grief could overcome the boy if his father, hated or not, was dead. Selfishly, I wondered how Huck’s incapacitation might affect me, but I felt only momentary guilt for that. Now that I had withheld the information for several days, Huck might become angry with me. He might betray me and cause my capture.

About dusk on the third day, I observed a column of smoke on the other side of the island. It was a terrifying sight. Maybe they were fishermen or hunters, though I was hard-pressed to know what game was there. I’d seen sign of some wild pigs, but they were plentiful on the mainland. I had seen only birds, snakes, squirrels and rabbits. I tensed and plotted which way I would run if I saw anyone, or, rather, if they saw me. I heard crunching footfalls on the forest carpet of dead leaves, and I was about to employ that route when Huck’s voice cut through the trees.

“Jim,” he called out, but not loudly.

“Here I is,” I said.

“We gotta go,” he said.

“I knows.” I pointed at the smoke.

“I made that fire. I thought some men was following me, so I built that to draw ’em off while we git.”

“Dat be good thinkin’,” I said.

“I put the canoe on the south point.”

“You sho dey comin’?”

“They was behind me, that’s all I know. I think they was followin’ me. I ain’t for certain sure.”

“Reckon we gotta leave, den. Cain’t be takin’ no chances.”

I put our food together while Huck changed out of his dress and back into his trousers and shirt. I wanted to hear his report, but I’d have to wait.

We cut through the center of the island to remain under cover. Not all of the floodwater had receded, so we found ourselves knee-deep in silty water. I had no doubt that we would be pulling leeches off each other. Huck was high-stepping because of his short legs, disturbing the water. I imagined that his splashing might ward off cottonmouths. Hoped more than imagined. We froze when we heard voices echoing through the woods. We carried our food and sparse gear over our heads.

“You best stop all dat splashin’, Huck.”

“I reckon so.”

“You know who dem is?”

“No, Jim. I don’t even know if’n they after us.”

“I sho nuff don’t wanna find out.”

We found the canoe and pushed it out into the water. We shivered, as we didn’t climb into the boat, but stayed in the water to keep a low profile. Soon we were away and in the current.

## Chapter 9


W**E CLIMBED INTO** the canoe and lay down. I asked the boy if he was okay and he said he was cold. I told him to take off his wet clothes and cover himself with the rag I’d used to pack the dried fish. I took off my shirt and tried to wring it out as much as I could.

“Did you see my fambly?” I asked.

“From a distance,” he said. “They looked awright. They looked sad.”

“What else you see? What you find out?”

Telling his story was allowing him to forget how cold and miserable he was. “First I landed on the beach, that little one just below the Stinson place, you know, where them grapes cover that fence.”

“I knows the spot.”

“Well, there was this lady in a shack. I don’t know if’n she was a Stinson or not. She was tall, near tall as you. To tell the truth, she sho looked like a man. She had big ol’ hands. I guess I got kinda wet and muddy ’cause she called me to her. She called me ‘gal.’ Kin you believe that?”

“She did?”

“But I don’t think she really believed it. She kept staring at me. But she liked to talk and she told me that folks was looking for my murderer. She didn’t say ‘my murderer,’ she said ‘Huck’s murderer.’ She said at first people blamed Pap and almost hanged him.”

“They din’t,” I said.

“No. How’d you know?”

“Guess.”

“She say then that they thought it was you what killed me.”

My heart sank.

“I kept thinkin’ that she knew it was me she was talkin’ to. Anyway, they started thinkin’ it was Pap Finn again. I guess it was because he run away from town and ain’t nobody seen him. There is a two-hundred-dollar bounty on his head.” He paused.

“What?”

“And there is a three-hundred-dollar reward for you.”

I said nothing.

“I sneaked into town to see if’n I could find Tom Sawyer. I thought maybe he could help us. But all the kids was locked inside on account of there bein’ a boy killer on the loose. At least, that’s what I figured.”

“Did ya hear anybuddy talkin’?”

“I heard the Judge Thatcher talkin’ to some feller, but they was sayin’ what I already done heard from that lady.”

“But you din’t talk to no slaves?”

He shook his head. “I slept in Miss Watson’s shed the one night. I sneaked into the kitchen and got us some candles and matches. I had some cheese, but I lost it. Then I couldn’t find the canoe. I hid out in that lady’s barn, but I had the feeling she knowed I was there. When I found the boat and set out, I spotted some men followin’ me. Least I think they was followin’ me.”

“How did my wife look?”

“Like I said, sad.”

“My baby girl?”

“Sad.”

I lay on my back and looked at the sky I couldn’t see and thought about that. I would come back for my family, I promised myself.

* * *

—

**WE MADE IT** to the shore and hid in the woods. The next morning we ate some of our food. Berries and catfish. We saved our dried fish and the biscuits Huck had stolen. Keeping an eye for boats passing on the river, we fashioned a modest raft with a lean-to cover and lashed it to our boat.

“We does our trabelin’ at night,” I told him. “We kin fish, eat and jest rest during da daytime.”

“That sounds right.” Huck turned over the fish that was cooking on the stick he held over the fire. “Can I ask you somethin’?”

“ ’Course.”

“Why you think Pap hates me?”

“*Hate* be a strong word,” I said.

“Well, what else you call it?”

“I reckon dat what you call it.”

“He hates you, too,” Huck said.

“ ’Course he hate me. I’s a slave.”

“Why he gotta hate you ’cause you’re a slave?”

“Just the way the world be, Huck.”

“Naw, he got a special hate for you.”

I nodded.

* * *

—

**DUSK CAME ON,** and with the fog we figured it was okay to set out. The Mississippi is swifter than it looks. It’s scary, for that reason. You can mess around in some branches and backwaters and start to think it’s gentle and then you get out into it and it’s a different story. Because of the recent flood we had to get pretty far from the bank or else we’d get caught up in brush or debris. That made it even more harrowing. The riverboats couldn’t see us, not that they would have steered to avoid us. And often, though they made plenty of noise, we couldn’t locate the vessels in the fog until they were very near. Their wakes rocked us crazily, more so because our shelter had made us top-heavy and lopsided. We spent much time baling water with the only two small cans we had. The work was exhausting.

The fog lifted and we could see the lanterns of the riverboats across the river. We saw Fourmile Island. It looked like it went on forever, and I realized just how far away my family was from me. Then Huck screamed and I looked back to see a huge riverboat right up on us. There must have been a problem with its engines because it made no sound. We paddled toward the shore as hard as we could. I could feel the draw of the water on us.

“Fasta, Huck\! You gots to dig in\!”

“I’m workin’\!” he cried.

We listed precariously toward the boat and then, as if the ship had a mind to let us go, we righted. I looked at Huck and he, too, knew what was coming. The wake. We grabbed on to our little craft the best we could, not just to keep it from capsizing, but to hold it together. The wake hit us, a wall of water. We lost some of our shelter. The wave soaked us through and we rocked violently. Holding on with one hand, we baled with abandon.

“You believe in Jesus?” Huck screamed.

“Sho,” I said. “But maybe you be the one to ax him fo help? He don’t seem to pay no mind to the wishes of no slave.”

The ship gone, we continued to bale. We rocked less violently.

“Did ya pray to da Lawd?” I asked.

“Never got a chance to,” Huck said. “We made it anyway.”

“I reckon we did.”

## Chapter 10


W**E MADE OUR WAY** downriver for a few days. Once we had drifted past Saverton, there wasn’t much to see. Still, we traveled by night and foraged during the day. We trolled a line a couple of times, but Huck nearly pulled a cottonmouth into the boat once, so we gave that up. The river split and narrowed and we determined that we could travel some by day. That plan was short-lived. We came back to the wide channel and saw some men pointing at us from the deck of a small riverboat. That scared us back into the dark.

One night, our fire burning, Huck asked, “Why don’t you just make me take you across that river? In Illinois you be a free man.”

I had thought of it, but somehow it just seemed like I’d be that much farther from family. Slavery didn’t recognize imaginary borders. I needed money. “I thinked on it, Huck. But you and me be friends. I cain’t just leave you.” And I meant that. Huck was just a boy.

Huck nodded. “You know where we goin’?” the boy asked.

“Ain’t got no idee. But we’s on our way.”

* * *

—

**NIGHT CAME** and we set out. About an hour later a storm came up and started knocking us about like we were a toy in the water. Lightning flashed south of us, but it was clearly headed our way.

“Whatcha think?” I asked.

“Dunno.”

“Stay in the wata wif lightnin’ ain’t a good idee.”

“Look\!” he said. He pointed.

Ahead of us, grounded on a shoal, was a wrecked steamboat. It leaned at nearly forty-five degrees. Huck paddled us forward while I used my oar as a rudder and tried my best to turn us away.

“What are you doin’, Jim?”

“Ain’t no good idee to be goin’ in dere.”

“Sure it’s a good idea. Who knows what we might find? Might even be some treasure. Gold and silver and diamonds and like that. Maybe we’ll find us a lamp with a genie in it.”

“Kin you think of anythin’ that kin get a slave killed faster than havin’ him some gold? And the genie sho nuff won’t grant a slave no wish.”

“Maybe there’s food, cans of beans and like that. More bacon.”

He had a point, but still I shook my head.

“Well, I’m going aboard.”

I gave in and helped him paddle us near the wreck. Once close, we could see that the boat wasn’t quite fully lodged on the shoal, but tethered to a big tree. Huck tied us to some bushes down the bank.

I stopped at the back of the boat where the big paddle lay dead and motionless. A broken spoke pointed toward the sky and another toward the far bank. The name of the boat was written across its back.

“Wha dat says?” I asked.

*“Walter Scott,”* Huck said.

“Wonder who he be.”

“That be the name of the boat, Jim.”

“Oh.”

“You not coming aboard?” he asked.

“Ima stay right heah. I be keepin’ watch.”

“That’s a good idea,” Huck said. “Give a signal whistle if’n there’s danger or somebody’s comin’.”

I watched as Huck climbed up the slippery deck. I then ducked under the tilted hull to get out of the rain.

* * *

—

**BECAUSE OF THE WIND,** my cover was hardly cover at all. I was fairly soaked through. I tried to think but couldn’t. Then Huck came careening down the deck and slid off into the water. He was shaking.

“We have to get out of here,” he said. “We’ve got to get out of here. We gotta run, Jim.”

“What is it, Huck? What be da matter?” I asked as we made our way to where we’d tied our boat.

Before he could answer, we saw that our craft had come undone and had drifted far out into the river. “I reckon I did a poor job of tying,” the boy said. “We got to hide. We need to hide.”

“Why?”

“There was some robbers in that boat. They was splittin’ up their loot and then one of ’em said they was gonna have to kill another feller. I didn’t see him. I don’t know where that ’un is.”

“I done told you not to go in, din’t I.” I shook my head. “Well, cain’t change nuffin naw.”

We heard deep voices from the *Walter Scott*. I pulled Huck into the bushes. We watched as the men put their takings into a skiff. Then a big wave came and lifted the *Walter Scott* and dropped it with a thud. Lightning flashed and thunder shook us. The storm was on us.

The men went back into the riverboat. I knew we had to get out of there. Our boat was gone. When I looked at Huck I saw he had the same notion. We stayed hidden in the brush and worked our way close, then we dashed for the robbers’ skiff. I untied the rope and the current snatched us out into the river in mere seconds. Another big wave lifted and slammed the wreck again. The robbers came running out onto the deck. We couldn’t see them, but we heard them shouting and swearing. I took the oars and did little more than keep us from capsizing, which was enough work.

* * *

—

**THE SKY UNTWISTED** itself and the storm flashed north of us, the thunder just a rumble now. I managed the boat to the bank, not because day was breaking, but because I was exhausted. We pulled up into the trees and lay on our backs. We were plenty wet, but no rain fell.

Once it was light, we went through the robbers’ booty, as Huck called it. The boy was highly excited by the adventure of it all. I admired that, was envious of it, to tell the truth, to be able to feel that in a world without fear of being hanged to death, or worse.

It turned out that the robbers didn’t care much for eating, as there was no food in the cache. There was jewelry, clothing, cigars. And books. I had to hide my excitement about the discovery of books. As to the monetary value of books I had no knowledge, but their intellectual value was immediately evident.

Among them were copies of Voltaire’s *Treatise on Tolerance* and *All for the Best* and Rousseau’s *Discourse on Inequality*. These were books I had seen on Judge Thatcher’s shelves and was eager to read. There was also a Bible and a book about training horses. And one pamphlet. I held it and studied the worn cream-colored cover. *The Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Venture, a Native of Africa: But Resident Above Sixty Years in the United States of America.* The slim volume felt soft, as if handled by sweaty hands. The work purported to be “related by himself.” *Related*.

“Maybe we kin sell the jewels,” Huck said.

I nodded.

“Why you holdin’ them books?” Huck asked.

“Dey feels good,” I said.

“That’s funny. How kin a book feel good?” He grabbed the Rousseau and thumbed through it. “It ain’t even got pictures.”

“I likes the weight of ’em,” I said.

Huck stared at me for a long few seconds. “I guess I don’t understand niggers,” he said.

Somehow that word seemed strange coming out of Huck’s mouth. I think he heard it, too, because we shared an awkward silence.

“Mebe I learn m’self to read wif dese books,” I said.

“You could probably find somethin’ better to start with than these.” He noticed that I had pushed aside the Bible. “You don’t want this ’un? The Bible?”

I felt cornered. “No,” I said. “Kin I keep dese?”

“I sure as shootin’ don’t want ’em.”

I put them in the sack they’d come in.

“You is a mystery to me, Jim, a sho nuff mystery.”

“I reckon I is, Huck.”

“First you don’t wanna go to Illinois where you kin be free and then you start collectin’ books causin’ they make you feel good. I swear I don’t understand.”

<<<START>>>

# Chapter 11: Wishes and Words

W**E WERE DRIFTING** by night when Huck brought up a tale, his eyes glowing with the ghostly light of the moon overhead. Mist clung around us like gauze and the river was a whisper beneath our makeshift raft. Our conversation turned to the peculiar mysticism of the East, to fantastical myths I had barely heard of but which fascinated Huck to no end.

"You ever hear 'bout a genie in a lamp, Jim?" Huck asked, his eyes wide with excitement.

"A genie?" I said, shaking my head. "Cain't say I had, Huck. What be dat now?"

"Why, a genie is a magical creature that lives in a lamp or a bottle. You rub the lamp and out it comes, granting you three wishes, anything you could ever dream of," Huck explained with the fervor of a convert to supernatural wonders.

"Mmmm. I'spect thass jest ol' white folks' funnin' tales," I said skeptically, though his excitement drew me in regardless.

Huck's face fell a bit, but his enthusiasm was unquenchable. “Naw, Jim! I heard it from Tom Sawyer. He read 'bout it in Arabia Nights. Ain't you never wished sumptin’, Jim?”

I paused. I had spent my life running from one oppressor to another, not in a position to indulge in the luxury of wishing. Wishes were slippery things—wild, dangerous, unfocused. Yet, something about the conversation stirred a long-buried yearning in me. To wish? To hope for something more, something beyond these shackles?

“Well, Huck, I reckon if'n I'se can wish fer anything, den I'se wish fer freedom. Not jest fer me, but fer Sadie and Lizzie and all my brethren who be shackled. We's all deserves to be free,” I said, my voice thickening with emotion I tried to keep bound within.

Huck nodded, lost deep in some fantasy beyond the moon's glow. “I'd wish for adventure, for you to be free, Jim. And that nobody never had to be scared of nobody no more.”

“Dat be commendable, Huck,” I said, “but do ye reckon wishes be dat simple? A wish kin’ have tails, spreading trouble like ripples 'cross this river.”

Huck sighed, the weight of this truth already wearing on his boyish spirit. Little did he know the stakes of his whimsical tales. “Why can't we just fix things with a few wishes, Jim? Why does everything have to be so hard?”

“Dat be the world, Huck, and she has many broken edges,” I replied wearily. I felt my exhaustion drag at the words, the endless cycle of hope and despair wearing thin on my spirit.

The night quieted as we drifted, the only sounds the gentle splashes of our oars and the soft whisper of the wind through the trees on the shore. I nurtured my doubts about these lamplight miracles Huck revered. It reminded me of stories I'd read back in Judge Thatcher’s library, where promises of magic and sudden, miraculous change feathered the hopes of many only to ensnare them deeper into their initial despair.

I glanced over and saw Huck's head drooping to his chest. Sleep claimed him, pulling him gently into its embrace. With the boy slumbering, I had a rare moment for myself. Reaching into the sack near our small stack of provisions, I felt for one of the precious books we had ‘liberated’ from the robbers. Carefully, I pulled out *All for the Best* by Voltaire. That man again. It was a funny thing, now having him traverse my reality in ink. But the written word, it had such a power—more formidable and subtler than any genie. Reading was always a subversive act for a man like me. A secret. A rebellion. An expression of my humanity.

As the lamp's dim light flickered uncertainly in the grip of the wavering night breeze, I cradled the book in my hands, savoring the feel of the dusty cover. I opened it slowly, reverently, as though uncovering some forbidden artifact.

I began to read.

Each word inscribed on the fragile pages was a spark, each paragraph a torch illuminating the dark corners of my constrained world. The constraints of my life on the Mississippi River ebbed, replaced momentarily by the expansive thoughts of the philosopher. I journeyed into these distant realms of reflection and discourse, a mental escape as palpable as if I had walked from a cramped cell into the wide, open fields.

Periodically, I glanced over at Huck’s sleeping form, ensuring he remained enveloped in the peace of dreams. The boy's rhythmic breathing was a comfort, a reminder of our curious bond amidst the chaos.

I returned to the book, each word more liberating than the last. Insights cascaded over me like refreshing springs in the sweltering southern heat. I felt as if Voltaire, with his wit and wisdom, was guiding me through this odyssey, mocking those stewards of oppression who regarded my race and kind as lesser—inferior.

Voltaire, Rousseau—they questioned everything, including notions of liberty and equality. Their works exposed the farcical nature of slavery and suggested that all human beings shared a fundamental equality. Despite all their flaws and condescending pity masked as empathy, their words carried the seeds of rebellion and freedom. In these pages, I found solace and strength.

Here I was, a runaway slave sought for crimes I hadn’t committed against a backdrop of a wild river, reading the profound musings of a man millennia away in ideologies. It struck an odd chord—the sheer irony of it.

Hours melted away as I delved deeper into the book. The weariness of the day, the worries about the next—everything blurred around the edges as the words pulled me into their embrace. Reading was an act of defiance—a small, personal revolution that reaffirmed my humanity.

The words blurred slightly under my watchful peering with the lamp, but they transported me far from my earthly chains. With each turn of the fragile page, I distanced myself from the palpable terror of a runaway’s life, floating instead through the boundless realms of thought crafted by Voltaire. It was an ethereal feeling, an otherworldly escape.

I read until dawn’s light began to creep over the horizon. Gently, mindful not to wake Huck, I closed the book, placing it back into the sack.

Physically, our journey had yet to conclude, yet spiritually, I had traveled miles. The power of words had shown me a vision of liberty far beyond any wish granted by genie lore. It was a freedom of thought, a sovereignty of mind that no master could shackle.

The boy stirred slightly, and I reached to pull the old blanket tighter around him, protecting the small flame of his innocence for one more night.

I dawned anew with the realization: true liberation will begin in the mind and soul before it's realized in the world. And I, Jim, was taking the first steps on that winding path, story by story, word by word.

# Chapter 12: Names and the Unseen River

B**Y GOOD FORTUNE**, we found the oak limbs of our canoe piled up in some brush against the shore. It was like the river accepted our fare and returned it later, like one of them roundabout dealings white folks sometimes talked about doing with banks and such. We pulled it free and dragged it up on the sand.

“It don’t look damaged,” Huck said, inspecting the hull. The boy was like a young inspector turning over every inch of the boat, checking for weaknesses like a soldier marking the terrain before a battle.

“Dere be some scratches,” I said, pointing at the bottom planks. “But it don’t be nuffin too bad. I reckon we can still make do wif it.” The sun was just creeping into the early morning sky, casting long shadows that scrambled with the quiet hum of a new day.

With our gear hastily stowed in the boat, we slipped back into the river’s current. It tugged and pulled as if welcoming us back into its folds. We drifted in silence for some hours, the water swirling around us and the trees on the shoreline blending into strange shadows that reflected in the glass-like expanse.

“You know, Jim,” Huck started, his voice cutting through the tranquility of the morning, “if you could pick any last name, what would it be?” He wasn't staring at me but looking out over the water like he expected to see the answer somewhere in the current.

I thought for a moment, letting the question stretch out between us into a form of contemplation. Names were more than sounds; they were declarations, affiliations, burdens, and dreams. I pondered over it the same way I’d consider the weight of an idea from one of them books hidden under the judge’s shelves.

“What last name would yuse pick if ya could?” I asked, turning the question back on him.

He looked surprised, as if he hadn’t considered that much for himself either. “Well, maybe something like ‘Thatcher.’ Judge Thatcher seems like a good name. He’s got a house, money, and respect; ‘Thatcher’ sounds strong.” Huck paused, took a deep breath. “But it ain’t ‘me,’ ya know? Just Huck Finn feels right.”

I nodded. “Well, if I gots to pick, reckon I’d pick sumthin' dat mean sumthin’ different, sumthin’ dat sounds lak it be lighter dan air, hopefuller. I reckon ‘Golightly’ be good nuff. Jim Golightly.”

“Golightly,” Huck repeated, letting the name roll in his mouth like a taste he wasn’t sure of but intrigued him nonetheless. “Why ‘Golightly’? Where did you hear a name like that?”

“Ain’t sure I heared it nowheres; jest sounds lak it means what I wants it to mean,” I said, settling into it, feeling the resonance. “Like I’m only here a while, and then I’s free.”

Huck nodded, his young face wrinkling in the moonlight as he considered this.

The hours moved along with the river, hushed and endless, until a growl broke through the pre-dawn quiet. A steamboat came up behind us suddenly, its unseen bulk cutting the water like a knife, sending ripples through, threatening our little craft. I felt the muscles in my throat clench as I called to Huck futilely.

“Huck, Huck!” I tried to shout above the roar, but the boy was a ghostly figure swallowed by the river’s mist. Panic took root, my hands instinctively gripping the boat's worn edges. We were both stunned by the abruptness of it: one moment driftin’ and discussing names, and the next skirting on panic’s edge.

“Huck!” I screamed again. The boat had already rushed fruitlessly around, carrying my panicked fervor out toward the open water.

“I got it, Jim!” A distant voice echoed. I turned and saw Huck deciphering where I was. Relief washed over me, though the heart-stopping alarm had my bones rattled. He had managed to get back to the raft as the steamboat whooshed past, a beast of smoke and noise leaving a hazardous wake.

Catching sight of him once more, I made my way toward the raft and clambered up. Finally reunited, I tried to shake off the residual fear, but it clung stubbornly to me.

“What happened to ya?” I asked Huck, checking him for injuries.

He laughed, a boyish chuckle that seemed irritatingly light-hearted for what we’d been through. “Ain’t nothin’, Jim. You was yellin’ like ya seen a ghost!” He gave me the sly Huck grin. “Maybe you was sleepin’.”

“Sleepin?” I said, flabbergasted. “Reckon I’s the one be sleepin’ if it weren’t fer that great ol’ beast?”

Huck carried on, crafting a playful narrative, “Yeah, you was mumblin’ somethin’, talkin’ in your sleep, and I wuz tryin’ to wake ya up. But here you be worried 'bout me!” He laughed again, the tension from the encounter lifting in the face of innocent jest.

“You play too much,” I grumbled, my earlier panic fading slowly. I couldn’t help but feel grateful for these moments in between crisis—we could still laugh, despite the dark truth of our fragility in the world.

The night went quieter again until Huck broke the stillness. “Jim, do you think what we're doin’ is right?” His words came out haltingly, like they were too heavy to lift.

“What ya be meanin’ by dat, Huck?” I wasn’t angry, more surprised by his sudden veer into moralizing.

“I mean, freein’ you. Ain’t I stealin’ you from Miss Watson? Ain’t that bad?”

I thought on it for a moment. Huck was wrestling with the ponderous weight of society’s conditioning and our complicated relationship, all with a child’s sense of morality. “Shacklin’ a man in the first place be the real stealin’. There be laws, Huck, but dem laws don’t define right and wrong. Dey jest rules made by men who in power.”

“I just don’t get why people don’t see it, Jim. Why don’t they see that it ain’t right?”

He had a good heart; that’s what gave me hope about the future. “It’s easier fer folks to follow rules rather than make moral choices. Real goodness don’t come from what other people tell ya to do, but from knowing right inside.” 

“I think I get it,” Huck said, though I wasn’t sure he fully comprehended. He’d have to carry that thought, the weight of it growing as he did.

The Mississippi was an endless whisper in our ears, urging us onward as the stars blinked overhead. The distant promise of the Ohio River loomed like an unspoken vow. The Ohio meant freedom, and in that freedom lay a dream—I would buy Sadie’s and Lizzie’s freedom, too.

“Do ya think you'll ever get to?” Huck asked, almost like he was probing my thoughts.

“Why any man dream if he don’t hope ta catch it?” I asked back, grinning at the shadowed boy.

“In this world, you gots ta keep hopin’. Hope’s da thing that gits ya floatin’ when ya bound in chains,” I answered finally, allowing us both to revel in the small comfort of hopeful thinking.

Huck lay back down on the raft, twirling a twig in his fingers, silent but thoughtful. “I like the name ‘Golightly,’” he eventually said, sleep pulling at his voice. I watched as his eyes closed against the night, his breathing becoming soft and even once more.

Our raft continued its quiet journey over the timeless, flowing river—an unwatched clock that ticked on, indifferent to the woes and dreams of men glowing under fickle moonlight. Names, morality, wishes—these were our companions, our fleeting ballast against the vagaries of reality. The night could hide the scars of our past, let us patch up dreams and virtues to carry us into the uncertain dawn that waited, somewhere just beyond the horizon, kissing the earth with promise.

# Chapter 13: The Flood and the Fever

T**HE MORNING AROSE** with a shiver downriver. I wrestled out from under the tarp we’d makeshifted over part of the raft, my head spinning from dreams already forgotten. The early fog swaddled the river, making the world beyond the immediate mist seem like a phantom’s playground. I could hear Huck talking, quiet at first but then sharper, more insistent. I crawled to my feet, careful not to make any noise.

"Huck, is dat you talkin’?" I called out softly, just loud enough.

There was a pause, the air pregnant with tension, then Huck’s voice came clearer, louder. "Yes, sir, that’s right. My pa’s sick with smallpox. Can’t have him around no other folks."

I froze. The realization hit me that Huck was doin' what he had got a knack for—lying his way outta trouble with quick thinking. And the stakes were high. I peeked through a crack in the tarp and saw two men in a skiff, lookin' suspicious and lean. Their eyes flicked around nervously. Clearly, slaver scouts.

The older man, grizzled and gray, squinted at Huck. "Smallpox, you say? That’s bad business. We best keep a distance."

The second man, younger but wiry, shifted uneasy. He spat into the water and scratched his head. "Maybe we should just see to ourselves, Lester."

I caught a glimpse of Huck. He stood ramrod straight, trying with all his might to look pitiful and desperate—just a boy takin’ care of his poor ol’ sick pa.

Another pause, then the older man spoke again. “Here, take this ten dollars," he said, tossing a crumpled note to Huck. "For your troubles, boy. Don't come near nobody till you git clear of that plague, hear?"

Huck caught the bill and nodded fervently, thanking them profusely. I watched as the men rowed off, still casting wary glances back our way. I didn’t move until they were well outta sight.

“Huck,” I whispered, crawlin' out from under the tarp, “you did it. You done it, boy.”

Huck shrugged offhandedly, but I could see the relief in his eyes. “Had to be fast on my feet,” he said. “We need to git off this river as soon as possible, Jim. We got lucky that time, but we might not be so again.”

We sat down, trying to figure our next move. The river was getting busier with traffic; ferries and steamboats moved like sleepy giants across the water. It made slipping away in our small raft trickier and more urgent.

I sniffed the cold air, the sharp stench of damp wood and muddy water filling my lungs. “Where be the canoe?” I asked suddenly, realizing I hadn't seen it.

Huck’s eyes darted around. “I don’t know. Maybe it drifted off.”

“Dat ain’t good,” I muttered as I scanned the bank for any sign of it. Truth was, I had a hunch it had been stolen, but there wasn’t much sense dwellin' on that when we had bigger fish to fry.

"We best get movin'," Huck said. "Stayin' here is jist askin' for trouble."

We pushed away from the bank, back into the main current. The day grew warmer, relieving the chill. But the river was surging, almost as if it knew it was being watched. It ebbed and flowed, pushing us this way and that, and we had to keep an eye out for the riverbound giants that prowled its waters.

We were balancing the raft as best we could when we saw another large riverboat ahead. The closer we got, the larger and more menacing it appeared. We paddled awkwardly, tryin’ to steer clear, but the ship loomed over us, casting a shadow that blocked out the sun.

“Paddle harder, Jim!” Huck shouted, his voice barely audible over the roar of the water and the toot of the boat’s foghorn.

“Doin’ ma best,” I called back, diggin’ the oar in with all the strength I could muster. The river’s pull was unforgiving.

The boat passed us, the wake leavin' mighty waves that rose higher than our little raft. I grabbed tight, knowin’ we were in for it.

“Huck, hold on\!” I yelled, but it was too late.

The first wave hit us like a brick wall. It lifted the raft, and we tumbled. The next wave followed, throwing us apart like rag dolls. I hit the water, sucked under by the torrent, limbs flailing. The chill of the river seized me, every muscle fighting against the current as I struggled to surface.

When finally I emerged, gasping for air, the world spun. I could see only the shattered pieces of the raft, floating debris, and the churning water all around. But no Huck.

I shouted his name, desperate, the words barely more than a wheeze. My heart pounded, louder than the roar of the river. I couldn’t see him. Panic surged through me, stronger than the current pulling me downriver. I kicked, splashed, called out again and again, “Huck\! Huck\!”

No answer. Only the relentless rush of the water, the stark, unyielding indifference of the Mississippi. My breath caught in my throat as the current swept me away, farther and farther from where I had last seen Huck, the boy who had become more than just a friend.

I clung to a piece of wood, the remains of our torn raft, my eyes still scanning the surface. Each second felt like an eternity. The space between breaths expanded, filled with the terror of the unknown, with the thought that I might have lost him for good.

A sob rose in my throat, bitter and frantic, yet I swallowed it back down. Crying wouldn’t help Huck. Crying wouldn’t save him. I had to keep searching. Keep hoping. Keep fighting against the tide. The river’s power was immense, but so was the bond I shared with that boy, a bond forged in the crucible of adversity and the whispers of freedom.

As I drifted, caught between despair and determination, one thing was clear: I had to find Huck. There was no other option. No other ending to this story that I could accept.

I wouldn’t stop. The current might carry me far, but my resolve, like the river, would not be easily broken.## Chapter 13

# Chapter 14: Shadows in the Free State

T**HE BRIGHT MORNING** sun was barely visible through the thick trees as I lay on the wet sand, coughing up river water. The world slowly came into focus. My body ached, the cold ground reminding me that I was alive, albeit just barely. The last vestiges of my fever and the venom left me feeling weak, dizzy.

Illinois. I knew we had drifted far, but had we gone far enough to land in a free state? I scanned the shoreline cautiously, seeing the river's edge stretch into a dense forest. My immediate need was to hide. A runaway has no luxury of being seen, even in the so-called free states.

I stood up on shaky legs, trying to get my bearings. The trees seemed to close in on me the farther I moved from the river. Each step was a struggle, a reminder of the fatigue that weighed down every muscle. Suddenly, I heard voices—not loud, but close enough to send a shiver down my spine. My instincts screamed for concealment, but curiosity and hope for some form of assistance pulled me toward the sound.

I rounded a thicket of bushes, only to come face-to-face with three black men, their faces showing the same hardened signs of struggle and fear that I wore. They were huddled around a small clearing, cautiously speaking in low tones.

"Who be you?" one of them asked, stepping forward. He was a strong-looking man, tall and muscular, his eyes wary but not hostile.

"Name’s Jim," I replied, holding my hands up slightly to show I meant no harm. "Jest washed ashore."

The man nodded, motioning for me to sit. "Name’s Josiah," he said. "These be Old George, Young George, and Pierre."

Old George was a wiry older man, his face lined with years of hardship. Young George, his son, seemed agile and creative, while Pierre, a lean and suspicious fellow, eyed me warily. The atmosphere was tense, but the fact that they hadn't sent me away was a small glimmer of hope.

Josiah spoke again, breaking the short silence. "We's all in the same boat, Jim. Escaped from different places. This here ain't safe, but it be better than where we come from."

I nodded, taking in their words. The air around us was thick with unspoken fears and shared understanding.

Josiah continued, "You kin read and write, you say?"

The surprise on their faces was a testament to how rare that admission was amongst escaped slaves. "Yessir, I can. Taught myself from books I found in the judge's library."

Old George's eyes lit up with a mix of amazement and something that felt like pride. Josiah leaned closer, curious. "How come you never got caught? White folks don't take kindly to no readin' nigger."

"I kept it a secret," I said simply. "No use flauntin' what could get me killed."

"Smart," Young George said, nodding approvingly. He turned to his father. "Pa, ifin he kin write, maybe...?"

Old George nodded. "Y'ain’t jest useful, Jim. You're powerful with them skills. More powerful than a lot of white folks can reckon."

I realized then just how much I might be able to help and how much danger I could bring upon us if I wasn’t careful. But there was a shared knowledge in literacy, an unspoken bond that set me apart enough to be significant.

Pierre remained silent, his eyes constantly scanning the woods around us. "Dogs," he muttered. "They'll come with dogs ifin they know."

The group shivered at that thought. Dogs could track us, surround us, tear us to pieces before the slave catchers even laid a finger on us.

Josiah turned his attention back to me. "Gonna hide in these woods a few days, Jim. But I warn you, it’s risky."

"I ain’t got much choice," I said, settling on the only plan that made sense. "But maybe while I'm hidin', I can help y'all by makin' some notes. Could be useful."

Curiosity flickered in Pierre’s eyes. "What kinda notes?"

"Records," I mumbled. "Ways of travel. Codes. Anythin' to help others like us."

Young George brightened up. "I git a pencil for you."

Pierre shot him a look. "Why trust him?"

Old George replied for me, his voice calm but firm. "Sometimes you gotta trust, Pierre. All this sneakin' and runnin' ain't no life ifin we never trust nobody."

Pierre hesitated before nodding reluctantly. "Alright then."

The men agreed to separate for now to avoid suspicion. It was a precarious camaraderie we had, one glued by desperation and a mutual yearning for freedom. They would return periodically, they said, to check on me. Young George would bring supplies, including the writing materials I so desperately coveted.

Before they left, Josiah pulled me aside. "Stay sharp, Jim. They's all after us, but you bein' able to read might be the thing that saves us."

"Thank ya, Josiah." I shook his hand, a gesture that felt monumental in its simplicity.

As they disappeared into the foliage, I settled by a thick trunk, the forest swallowing their parting words. I pulled out one of my prized books from the sack, fingering the cover of *The Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Venture*. It was a physical reminder of what literacy granted me—a connection to a broader humanity, a sense of purpose beyond mere survival.

I started reading, the quiet of the woods easing my frayed nerves. Each word provided solace, transforming the pressing silence into a shared history, a source of strength. As the afternoon stretched into evening, the comfort of reading dulled my immediate fears—if only briefly.

The encroaching darkness ruffled the leaves and sent critters scurrying, making the woods feel alive, watchful. I couldn't ignore the nagging paranoia that Pierre's unyielding suspicion had planted within me. But as I tucked the book away, the pressing weight of the letters and the faith it contained fortified my spirit.

Tomorrow, I would begin writing. Not just for myself but for all of my people—those running, those hiding, those dreaming of a life beyond the chains. Literacy was both my sword and shield; with it, I'd carve a path through the dense treacheries of a world that wasn’t yet ready to see men like me as equals.

Hope anchored me, even as shadows stretched longer across the clearing. The river had carried and battered me. The woods now hid and held me. Amid all uncertainties, one truth remained: I would not abandon this fight—neither for myself nor for the countless souls bound together in the very struggle for freedom's defining promise.## Chapter 14

# Chapter 15: Voices of the Night

S**OMETIMES, THE WOODS** breathe like a living thing. Every leaf, every rustle, has a story to tell, and out here, story and survival are twins. I pulled myself up from the sandy earth and shook off the lingering dampness. The morning light whispered through the treetops, turning the river into a silver thread cutting through the green expanse. 

I needed food. My muscles ached, and my mind was a tangled mess of thoughts that had spiraled out of control during the night. The first task was to find some sustenance—not just for the body, but for the spirit too. I had spent too much time running on adrenaline; now survival required something more tangible.

* * *

**THE DENSE UNDERGROWTH** provided a few berries and some wild greens. Not much, but enough to stave off the gnawing emptiness in my belly. Each berry was savored, its sweetness a fleeting distraction from the harsh realities of our journey.

Reading became my lifeline. Even though the forest felt more like a cage, the printed words provided an escape. Voltaire, with his wit and wisdom, and even the Bible, with its contradictory teachings, opened windows to worlds far beyond my own. Yet, reading by daylight in the woods felt like exposing secrets to the sun—vulnerable, raw.

Each book had its own voice, its own way of questioning and revealing. The words flowed into me, each sentence a sip of clarity in a murky world. It struck me then, the need to not just consume these thoughts, but to organize them—externalize and make them my own.

In the coolness of the afternoon, I began to feel restless. Young George had promised to return, and I found myself anxious for his arrival. The pencil he’d promised seemed almost mythical, filled with the potential to free my thoughts from the confines of my mind and trap them onto paper.

The minutes dragged until, finally, the shadows lengthened and the air cooled. I heard a soft rustle and knew he had come.

Young George stepped cautiously into the clearing, a mischievous grin lighting up his face. Without a word, he handed me a pencil, its wood warm from being in his pocket.

"Took some doin'," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "Swiped it from a trader’s pack while he weren’t lookin’." He chuckled, the sound a rare, comforting presence in the dense woods.

I held the pencil like it was a sacred relic, feeling its weight in my hand. It represented more than just a tool—it was a lifeline, a way to channel my thoughts into something organized, tangible.

"Sho appreciate this, Young George," I said, my voice thick with gratitude.

We sat together, the dusk stealing in around us. For a while, we laughed, our voices blending with the symphony of the forest. The sound of joy was an act of defiance, a reminder of our shared humanity.

"You gots stories, Jim," Young George said. "But you sees with yo eyes and hears with yo ears. You tells yoself to listen more. Da woods tellin’ you somethin’, you just gotta hear it."

I nodded, digesting his words. "You right. Ain’t nobody tellin' dey story jes' wit’ dere mouth. Dey ears hear da truth, sometimes ‘fore dey say it."

The advice settled into me, opening a new perspective. This pencil wasn’t just for writing—it was a connection to the world around me. I would listen to the woods, the river, even the animals, and I would let them guide my thoughts.

As the last sliver of sunlight disappeared, Young George rose to leave. "Stay safe, Jim. We all in dis togetha.” His silhouetted form melted into the gathering night, leaving me alone but not lonely.

I glanced at the pencil one more time, feeling its promise. Young George’s laughter and words echoed in my mind, offering me courage to face the uncertainties that lay ahead.

* * *

**THE NIGHT FELL** swiftly, the inky blackness weaving itself into every crevice of the forest. I pulled myself into a tighter ball atop a mound of tree roots, the faint light from the stars barely penetrating the canopy. The pencil was tucked safely in my pocket, a talisman of sorts.

I was on the cusp of sleep when the distant baying of hounds shattered the fragile peace. My heart lurched into a sprint, adrenaline flooding my veins. The sound grew closer, the dogs’ howls piercing the night air with a primal urgency that sent every instinct roaring to life.

I wasn’t the only one listening. A raccoon, its eyes glowing like twin lanterns, stared at me from a nearby branch. In its gaze, I saw my own fear reflected, a shared anxiety that bridged the gap between species.

Were we both the prey tonight? The thought gnawed at me. The dogs could be near, or they could be miles away. Unable to gauge the distance, I weighed my options: run or stay hidden. Which direction would I run? The dogs’ baying seemed to echo from every shadowed corner of the woods, offering no clear path to safety.

The raccoon twitched, its tiny nose hovering in the air as it sniffed for danger, trying to decide its own course of action. I mirrored its stance, every muscle coiled, ready to spring at the first sign of immediate threat.

Minutes passed, the hounds’ cacophony rising and falling. I pressed myself closer to the tree roots, melding into the earth. My breaths came shallow and quiet, every fiber of my being straining to remain still.

The pencil in my pocket felt heavier than ever, a reminder of what was at stake. I couldn’t afford to be caught. I had too much to tell, too much yet to understand and write. The dogs couldn’t reach me here, not tonight. I steeled my resolve, willing my heart to slow, my senses to sharpen.

One howl burst louder than the rest, sending a shiver along my spine. But then, as suddenly as the baying had begun, it started to fade, the echoes dispersing into the deeper parts of the forest.

The raccoon scampered up the tree, its anxiety mirroring my own. With a silent nod to the creature, I let out a slow, careful breath. I was safe, for now, but the reminder was clear: vigilance was my only ally.

The night returned to its deceptive calm. I stayed awake, the pencil a promise in my pocket and the echoes of hounds a stark reminder of the chase. In the stillness, I listened—truly listened—to the voices of the night, absorbing their wisdom and steeling myself for the stories yet to be written.

The forest and I stood guard together, each whispering secret hopes and prayers to the stars, every rustle a chapter yet to unfold.## Chapter 15

# Chapter 16: Run for Freedom

S**ITTING IN THE** cool early morning light, I found myself reflecting on the life I’d left behind. The woods were quiet with only the occasional chirp of an early-rising bird. I was safe here, for the moment, but safety bred contemplation, and my thoughts inevitably wandered back to Hannibal, Missouri. Thoughts of Sadie and Lizzie, their faces vivid in my mind, their laughter an echo of better days. But these weren't just memories born of longing. They were the foundations of my resolve, the bedrock of my determination to keep moving forward.

In Hannibal, I was defined by my chains, by the whims of Miss Watson and the cruelty of an inhumane system. Here, in the freedom of the woods, there was a different kind of power—one that allowed for reflection, for the weaving of my own narrative. I had found a strange freedom in these stolen moments with the books I had managed to keep hidden from prying eyes. It was through these words that I could redefine myself. Not as a slave, ever-fearing, ever-hiding, but as Jim Golightly—a man of thought and purpose, a man striving for something more.

The power of writing was a revelation. It allowed me to not only share my experiences but also to solidify my identity in a world that continuously tried to erase it. With each careful stroke of Young George's stolen pencil, I could craft my own story, away from the prying eyes of overseers and masters. It was a magic that seemed more tangible, more real, than any of the tales of genies and lamps that Huck had spoken of.

* * *

**JOSIAH, OLD GEORGE**, Pierre, and Young George found their way to my clearing later that morning. They moved with the caution of men who knew the woods held both salvation and threats in equal measure. Our conversations, often held in whispers, were moments of shared wisdom and communal planning. They were filled with the hard truths of our shared condition and the stark risks we faced.

Josiah spoke of the North, of a place where a man might walk on his own terms and craft his own destiny. "Up dere," he said, "a man kin be his self, not worryin' 'bout bein' chained or sold. Dey say dere's whole towns where nobody kin touch ya—not no white man, not no slave catcher."

Old George chimed in, his voice carrying the weight of years of hardship. "It's dangerous though. Gotta know who to trust. Some folks up dere ain't no better'n here. Skin color don' change da heart."

We nodded, absorbing the gravity of his words. Trust was a fragile commodity, but it was all we had to rely on.

Pierre remained silent, his eyes scanning the surroundings as if expecting trouble at any moment. His suspicion was a survival trait honed over years of evading capture.

Young George, who had brought me the precious pencil, sat beside me, his face a mixture of hope and fear. He'd mentioned to me earlier the need to carve out a life beyond the clutches of slavery, dreams that mirrored my own.

"I been thinkin'," I began, my voice low but steady, " 'bout runnin' north. Findin' a way to buy my family’s freedom. I know it be risky, but stayin' here, we ain't got no future neither."

Josiah nodded thoughtfully. "You might be right, Jim. If you make it, you might find a place for all us. But it ain't gonna be easy."

"Ain't never been easy," Old George muttered grimly. "But you got heart, Jim. You got fight in ya."

Their words fortified my resolve. I knew the journey north would be fraught with danger, but the possibility of true freedom and reuniting with my family was worth every risk.

* * *

**THAT AFTERNOON**, I set to work weaving a small bag from grass and reeds, a skill I'd learned back at the plantation. It was a task that required patience, but it provided a momentary respite from my fevered thoughts. With the bag completed, I set out to gather fish, drying them for the journey ahead.

As night fell, I slipped into the woods, the bag slung over my shoulder. Darkness was both a shield and a treacherous guide. I moved cautiously, guided by the faintest tracings of light and shadow. The forest seemed to hold its breath, every rustle and whisper magnified in the stillness.

It was nearing midnight when I heard the distant sound of voices and the unmistakable crack of a whip. My heart pounded as I crept closer, keeping to the shadows. What I saw made my blood run cold.

Young George was tied to a tree, his back bloody from the lashes of an overseer’s whip. The man wielding it was a cruel-looking figure, drunk on the power he held over another's suffering. Josiah, Old George, and Pierre were there, forced to watch, their faces etched with helpless rage.

I moved silently, finding a vantage point from where I could observe without being seen. As the overseer raised the whip again, my eyes locked with Young George’s. Despite the pain, his eyes were clear and steady, and in that fleeting moment, he silently urged me to run.

The overseer's cruel voice broke the silence. "Stealin' from your betters, boy? This is what happens."

The lash fell again, and I felt each strike as if it were my own flesh being torn. But there was a different kind of urgency building within me. Young George’s silent plea was a beacon—a call to action. His sacrifice, his suffering, could not be in vain.

I backed away slowly, my resolve solidifying with each step. Fleeing was the only way to honor Young George's resistance. To stay would mean certain capture and likely death for all of us.

With a final look at the scene, I turned and ran, my feet silent on the forest floor. Each step was powered by the urgent need to survive, to find that freedom Josiah had spoken of, and to buy my family out of bondage.

The forest seemed to thrum with life, branches whipping past me as I moved with purpose. Every breath was a reminder of the stakes. Every heartbeat a promise to keep moving forward.

The night swallowed me, but I emerged on the other side—wounded, yes, but also determined. I would write my story. I would carve my path north. And I would carry Young George’s courage with me, a guiding light in the darkest of journeys.

Running north was not just about escaping—it was about reclaiming my own destiny. And I would do it, step by step, under the cover of night and driven by the hope that freedom was not just a distant dream but a tangible possibility within my grasp.## Chapter 16

# Chapter 17: Espy of War and Words

T**HE WOODS WERE** unnervingly silent. Each step I took was cautious, every sound magnified in the hush of pre-dawn. The sun showed no signs of rising just yet, but it wouldn't be long. I needed a hiding place, somewhere to lay low until full darkness blessed me again with its cover. 

The ground was wet from dew, every leaf a potential pointer to my passage. Slipping into a narrow pathway bordered by tall trees and dense undergrowth, I caught a glimpse of the river through the breaks in the foliage. The Mississippi. Our path to freedom.

Voices echoed in the silence. Angry, agitated - words flying like birds startled from their roost. An argument, it seemed, but between whom? My grip tightened on the branch I held for support. A flash of recognition hit me like a bolt of lightning. Amongst the raucous voices, I distinctly recognized another - Huck. My heart quickened, the realization both a beacon of hope and a wisp of fear.

I skulked through the underbrush, drawn toward the clamor. It wasn’t long before I could see them, Grangerfords and Shepherdsons, facing off like wolves. Bloodlust was clear on their faces. That's when I spotted Huck crab-running towards me, eyes wide, frantic. Near him, a young woman - Sophia, if memory served right - was running in another direction, her dress flapping like distressed wings.

I reached out, grabbing Huck by his arm and pulling him into the dense bushes. Leaves and twigs whispered secrets of our passing. We huddled together, breath mingling, our ears straining to catch every sound. The clamor reached a deadly climax as the gunfire erupted, a cacophony that spoke of desperation and bloodshed.

“We gots to git outta here,” I murmured, daring only the barest whisper.

Huck nodded, his face pale, eyes wide with fresh horror. “Jim, them folks be killin’ each other for nothin’ but pride. We gotta move quick.”

We peered through the leaves, witnessing the chaos. Bodies lay crumpled like broken dolls, the earth greedily drinking their blood. The feud had claimed more victims, but I couldn’t bear to count. These Southern fields, soaked in ancestral hatreds, were no place for us.

”Come on,” Huck led the way, moving like a practiced shadow. We darted through the trees, making our way back to the patch of river where he’d found the old raft.

“Look, Jim, I found this raft a few days ago, washed up and a bit broken,” Huck explained hurriedly. “I fixed it up. It mean we can bust outta here right now.”

Hand in hand, with staccato breaths and trepidation fixed in our minds, we moved the raft to the river’s edge. The water lapped eagerly, tasting freedom for us.

Once we were drifting down the river, the stark horror of the morning began to recede. The Mississippi had a way of carrying the past away with it, but never too far. It loomed at the horizons, like a haunting memory just out of sight.

Huck cast glances my way. His eyes narrowed thoughtfully, chewing over something he wasn’t sure if he should spit out. Finally, he broke the silence.

“Jim, there’s somethin’ I gotta ask ya,” he began hesitantly. “When we was in that brush, and you was talkin’, you didn’t sound like… well, like you.”

“Wha’ you mean, Huck?” I tried to keep my voice steady, falling into the familiar drawl.

“I mean… you sounded different. Like one o' them smart white folks. Like Judge Thatcher or somethin'. Not like how you’s been talkin’ before.”

I paused, considering my words carefully. “Huck, it be da heat o’ da moment. I been scared, same as you. Sumtimes, we say what we say without thinkin'.”

He wasn’t fully buying it. "Yeah, but it was more than that. You sounded like you know all them big words. Not like the way you usually talk. You sure it ain't nothin' else?"

I met his gaze evenly, returning to my usual pattern of speech. “Huck, sometimes folks git scared and words come out different. I remember them books I done read and reckon I pulls them words up when I needs 'em most.”

Huck looked at me, curiosity mingling with suspicion. “I don’t 'spect ‘nother feller to be readin’ books ‘cept if he went to school or seen a lotta libraries. You tellin’ me Miss Watson's place had all them books you read?”

“I be learnin’ on my own, Huck. It be da only way fer a man like me to survive.”

Satisfied for the moment, though clearly still processing, Huck reclined against the raft’s makeshift shelter. "Yeah, guess that makes sense," he said, his voice drifting off. "We gotta keep on our toes, Jim. Ain't no tellin’ what else might come at us 'fore we reach the end of this river."

I nodded in agreement, letting the conversation trail away into the gentle gurgle of water under the raft. It wasn't that Huck couldn't understand, but rather that he was young, grappling with complexities beyond his years and beyond his experiences. For now, he would let it rest, and we both settled into a tense but comfortable silence as the Mississippi whispered its endless secrets beneath us.

As our raft carried us further, I let my thoughts roam ahead to what lay beyond the watery expanse—the hope of freedom, the weight of my family's fate, and the unyielding bond growing between me and this imaginative, tender-hearted boy named Huck. There were shadows yet to traverse, tests of faith and endurance we had to face. But for now, we had each other and the shared purpose that drove us forward. The future lay uncharted, a vast unknown, as boundless and promising as the rivers that lay before us.## Chapter 17

# Chapter 18: Crowns in Shadows

T**HE NIGHT REVEALED** its many secrets as our raft drifted silently down the Mississippi. The river’s dark ripples mirrored the fragmented stars above, holding the promise of both refuge and peril. Huck and I, huddled under the weathered canvas tarp, whispered about the bloody feud we had narrowly escaped.

“You think they all hate like that for real?” Huck asked, his voice carrying the uncertainty of a boy who had seen too much.

“I reckon it be deep as dat river,” I said, my mind replaying the violent scene. “Hatreds what’s been pass down from fathers to sons. Leastways, it seems dat way.”

The landscape around us darkened further, as if drawing a protective veil over our conversation. Beyond the immediate shadows, our future loomed uncertain, but our shared stories—stark recent memories—bound us closer. We floated in a comforting silence, interrupted only by the murmur of the river.

We glided onto a sandy beach, a hidden cove shrouded in dense brush. The small, sturdy canoe securely lashed to a tree stump caught our eyes. Huck eyed it with curiosity, the wheels of his cunning mind already turning.

“I’ll take it fer a lil’ test run,” Huck said eagerly. “You mind the trotlines, Jim.”

I sensed the undertone of excitement in his voice, but also the insatiable need for a momentary escape, a boy’s adventure free from the heavy burdens we carried. Nodding, I watched as Huck deftly untied the canoe and paddled it up the creek, leaving me to tend to our fishing traps and thoughts.

Twirling the piece of pencil Young George had given me, I thought about the night that awaited. As the moon overhead cast eerie shadows on the water, I felt its pull, a tug stronger than the river currents. Exhaustion carried me off to uneasy shores, and I found myself wandering in sleep.

* * *

**IN THE DREAM**, I was seated in Judge Thatcher’s library, the scent of a burning fireplace mingling with the aged leather of countless tomes. Opposite me sat John Locke, his eyes glinting with the weighty wisdom of centuries. He looked as I imagined, up close—a prominent figure, dressed in 17th-century attire, embodying the stoic thoughtfulness of a man who had spent his life contemplating the depths of human nature.

“You’re familiar with my work, I presume?” Locke asked, his voice a blend of academic rigor and gentle curiosity.

“Yes, suh. I read *Two Treatises of Government*. Ain’t real easy readin’, but I reckon I grasp the gist of it,” I responded, though a lingering doubt about the nature of his opinions gnawed at my consciousness.

Locke took a sip from his brandy glass. “Tell me, Jim, what are your thoughts on liberty and the rights of man?”

I weighed his question, the gravity of my circumstances melting into the dreamscape. “I reckons liberty be the right to choose. Like you said, men are born free, and shackles be the abomination. But how you reconcile dat with our reality?”

Locke nodded thoughtfully. “Indeed, theory and practice often diverge. Hypocrisy abounds in human affairs—principles are evoked but rarely upheld. Men in power manipulate such tenets to serve their whims.”

I felt a pang of frustration. “And we be sufferin’ for it. Hypocrisy be a weapon, not a shield.”

Locke’s eyes softened. “True. But knowledge—true understanding—can dismantle such hypocrisy. You, Jim, with every word you write, defy the chains they lay on your mind.”

As he spoke, the dream began to fracture, a distant sound rising, tearing away the calming presence of Locke and replacing it with a sense of imminent peril.

* * *

**I AWOKE** to the sharp call of Huck’s voice and the jarring bay of hounds growing nearer, cutting through the gossamer threads of my dream. Instinctively, I grabbed our few possessions, rushed to the raft, and saw Huck hurrying towards me. He tugged along two disheveled white men—one old, gaunt and sinister; the other young, stout, and equally alarming.

“Quick! Help me get the raft into the river!” Huck’s voice carried an edge of fear I hadn’t heard before.

We worked fast, tying the raft to the canoe and pushing off into the safety of the river’s current as the hounds’ baying grew nearer.

The older man was the first to speak once we put some distance between ourselves and the dogs. “Good heavens, boy! Y'all saved our skins! Them rabid beasts would have had us fer shore!”

He introduced himself with a dramatic flourish. “I am the rightful King of France, known here as the Dauphin!” His pride was estranged yet striking, like a dented crown held over his head.

The younger man, more composed, gave a shallow bow. “And I,” he proclaimed, “am the Duke of Bridgewater, or Bridgewater—to my friends.”

Huck and I exchanged a skeptical glance, but the pretense served a purpose—there was a kind of cautious peace in humoring the delusions of men who could prove dangerous. Hiding our disbelief, we played along for now.

“Well, yer majesty,” Huck added with an exaggerated nod, “I reckon ya safer here on our raft ’n back on that shore. What kin’ we call ya?”

The Duke replied on behalf of both. “Just call him ‘Your Grace,’ and call me ‘Your Lordship.’”

I marveled at their audacity—a strange mix of admiration and disdain. We sat in silence a moment, floating on the river’s mysterious embrace, each of us lost in our own thoughts.

“Y’all got a mighty strange way of introducing y’selves,” Huck murmured, breaking the lull.

The Dauphin regarded him with icy pride. “Ah, young man, life’s theater, and a king must role-play even amongst commoner dew.”

I shot Huck a look, urging him to keep our situation controlled. “We got a long journey ahead. We welcomes y’all to our modest craft.”

The Duke leaned towards me conspiratorially. “Quite so, quite so! And if there’s opportunity for profitable... collaborations...” His voice trailed off suggestively.

Recognizing the danger and complexity these men brought to our journey, we settled into a wary, uneasy truce. They were both unpredictable, their veneer of civility precarious. Riding down the Mississippi with self-styled royalty added a volatile element to our expedition, but Huck and I understood that we had little choice but to accommodate these dangerous actors in our makeshift theater.

Under the cloak of night, our raft navigated the labyrinthine waters, shadows stretching and bending around us. Caution enveloped us, each ripple on the river whispering the promise of new adventures forged with both hope and peril intertwined. 'Twas a delicate balance of deception and survival, one that neither Huck nor I dared miscalculate.

Hidden by darkness, the Mississippi carried us toward the unknown—an intricate dance of cunning and hope meandering on its relentless course, masked by the moon’s dispassionate gaze.## Chapter 18

# Chapter 19: The Fools and The River

T**HE NIGHT SKIES**, ever the guardian of secrets, draped our moments in foreboding whisperings. As the raft floated lazily along the Mississippi, the Duke and the King, fresh from their recent brush with danger, began to scrutinize us closely. Huck and I knew that we were as open as the river itself, our backgrounds subjected to their piercing examinations.

“Now tell me, young man,” the Duke queried, his voice dripping with a fraudulent charm, “how is it that you, a boy of such tender age, and your... servant here,” he gestured toward me with a pointed finger, “find yourselves adrift without proper companionship?”

I shot Huck a careful glance before placing my eyes forward, each second a calculation. If our lies were to be believed, they had to be flawless, seamless like the river’s own current.

“Our story is a sad one, Duke,” Huck began hesitantly, embracing his talent for spinning elaborate fabrications. “We lost our whole family in a terrible riverboat accident. Me and Jim here, we’re headed south to New Orleans. My uncle, you see, he’s in trouble and needs help. We figured it’s the least we can do for family, seein’ as we ain’t got no other kin.”

The King’s eyes narrowed, skepticism mingling with curiosity. “Riverboat accident, you say? Lost all your kinfolk?” He probed, attempting to wring out any inconsistency in Huck’s tale.

“Yes, Your Majesty,” Huck continued unfazed. “Ain’t much left fer us. Uncle’ll be right happy to see us. Ain’t that right, Jim?” He turned to me, imploring with his eyes.

“Yessir, dat be true,” I confirmed, mustering every ounce of conviction I had. Each word spoken was like navigating treacherous waters, any misstep potentially leading to disaster.

Satisfied for the moment, the Duke nodded. “A tragic tale indeed, lad. Your bravery shall not go unrewarded. Rest assured, we’ll reach New Orleans, and your uncle shall receive the aid he needs.”

The King, less noble in his demeanor but far more curious, added, “Rest on the shore tonight then. The storm approaches, and we ain’t keen on getting drenched.” His orders were as condescending as a monarch’s dictums, and I saw Huck’s jaw tighten slightly.

Under the guise of impending rain, we steered the raft to the riverbank. The tempest began its feral dance, sheets of rain cascading upon us like a vengeful deluge. We huddled under sparse shelter, the Duke and the King having claimed the most comfortable spots, leaving Huck and me in uneasy positions.

As the storm raged, turning night to a tempestuous symphony, we waited in a state of vigilance. Each crackling bolt of lightning illuminated our grim expressions. Each thunderous clap seemed to echo the tension in our minds. Finally, morning’s first light broke through, and with it, a temporary calm.

After the storm, the Duke and the King resumed their air of assumed entitlement. “We need proper food,” the King declared with disdain. “This subsistence is far beneath our station.”

“Let’s venture into the nearest town,” the Duke proposed. “We’ll put on a grand show, earn ourselves a princely sum. Surely the good folks will pay to be entertained.”

My unease deepened. An all too familiar fear gnawed at me—what if their plans involved risking Jim's safety? What if they intended to sell him outright, using the profits to finance their deceptions in some grand town?

Huck voiced our shared concern. “But, Your Majesty, Your Lordship,” he stammered, addressing them both cautiously, “we can’t exactly stroll into town. They might mistake Jim here... they might think he’s a runaway. You wouldn’t want trouble with the law now, would ya?”

The King’s eyes glinted with unsettling possibilities. “Oh, but think, lad! If I were to claim him as mine, merely for the show’s duration, just to ease folks’ worries?” His voice feigned benevolence, though the sinister undertone was unmistakable.

I couldn’t keep quiet any longer. “No, suh. Jim cain't be claimed. I’s a free man in every heart whar freedom beats.” My hand clenched into a fist. I knew the recklessness of my boldness, but denying his claim was an act guided by principle and desperation.

The Duke tried to mitigate the tension that spiked through our group. “No need for conflict," he said smoothly. "The boy’s right. We don’t want trouble.”

Huck took a deep breath, standing beside me. “I can’t let you, sir. Jim ain’t for you to claim. He's a good man, got a heart as big as this river. We look after each other.” His voice remained steady, fervent with a mixture of anger and the youthful idealism that slavery had yet to crush within him.

The King gave a dismissive wave, a knowing smirk curling his lips. “Alright then, as the boy says. No claims.” But the edge in his tone was unsettling; deceit undoubtably simmered beneath his concession.

The morning sun tugged the fog from the river. The rift between us and those self-titled monarchs stretched, an invisible current whipping us downstream. Each reticent step towards our food-making scheme now recognized the stark reality Huck and I constantly navigated—protection, deception, survival.

I looked at Huck, seeing a fierce loyalty I wished for no child to know. But these times carved men out of boys by shared hardship and the yearning for freedom. Our bond grew deeper, reforged even amid the undulating waves of danger.

“Stick close,” I murmured, my voice low but resolute. “Together, we gon’ power through this river, make it past any crown in our path.”

A subtle nod was Huck's answer, his eyes locked on the horizon. And while our journey was far from its end, the dawn’s light illuminated one clear truth: freedom, absent such false crowns’ shadows, was the dream that tugged us inexhaustibly forward.## Chapter 19

# Chapter 20: The Long Way to Freedom

T**HE FIRST GLEAMS** of dawn broke through the dense fog that clung to the river like a shroud. The Duke and the King, ever restless and scheming, decided it was time to move into a nearby town to "start some business," as they put it. They insisted that Huck and I accompany them, a choice that left both of us uneasy. When conmen like them had a plan, it usually meant trouble for everyone involved.

As we worked to secure the raft, I couldn't help but glance at Huck. His face was set in a determined grimace, a far cry from the boy who had once been carefree and unburdened by the world's darker truths. This journey was shaping him, molding him into something stronger, but at a cost.

"Ready?" Huck asked, his voice steady but tinged with worry.

I nodded. "Ain't got much of a choice, do we?" I replied, hefting the last of our supplies onto the shore.

The Duke and the King led the way, their swagger evident despite the early hour. They were buoyed by their own grandiosity, unaware or simply uncaring about the danger they dragged us into.

"Keep up," the Duke sneered, glancing back at us. "Wouldn't want to lose you in the early morning mist."

We shared a look, Huck and I, and followed silently. The town was just starting to wake up, thin plumes of smoke rising from scattered chimneys, the smell of breakfast wafting through the air. The buildings were modest, a testament to hard-won livelihoods and a community that likely didn't take kindly to strangers.

Almost immediately, we encountered a man—a middle-aged fellow with a suspicious squint and a permanent scowl etched into his lined face. He eyed us critically as we approached.

"Morning," the Duke greeted him, his fraudulent warmth practically oozing. "Can you direct us to where the good folk of this town might be at this hour?"

The man spat on the ground, wiped his chin with a rough hand. "Ain't no good folk 'bout," he muttered. "They's all up at the revival meetin', near the big field yonder."

"Much obliged," the Dauphin said, tipping an imaginary hat. The man grunted and walked away, muttering to himself.

The Duke and the King exchanged a look that spelled trouble. "A revival meeting," the Duke mused, stroking his chin thoughtfully. "Full of good, generous souls, no doubt."

"A prime opportunity," the King agreed, a devious smile breaking across his gaunt features.

We felt the tension rise as we neared the revival grounds, a vast field encircled by simple wooden benches and a makeshift stage at its center. The air thrummed with the fervor of hopeful believers, their voices lifting in song and prayer, reaching for something higher than the mundane struggles of their everyday lives.

The Duke turned to the King, his eyes gleaming with scheming intent. “You’ll pose as a reformed pirate," he instructed. "And I shall grace them with a monologue from Shakespeare.”

The King dismissed any concerns with a wave of his hand, already practicing a self-deprecating, humble demeanor. I watched them, feeling my stomach knot. Their plan was bound to collapse, and when it did, we needed to be ready to bolt.

“Stay close,” I whispered to Huck. “Dis gone go bad.”

“I know it," Huck replied, his eyes never leaving the Duke and the King.

The revival leaders welcomed everyone into the gathering, the large preacher—an imposing figure with broad shoulders and a booming voice—warming up the crowd with fervent declarations of redemption and the path to salvation. He was clearly a man who commanded respect, his powerful presence leaving little room for dissent.

As the King and the Duke took center stage, the crowd grew quiet, their curiosity piqued by the outlandish claims being made. The Duke, casting aside any semblance of subtlety, launched into Hamlet’s soliloquy, his exaggerated gestures and overblown oration drawing puzzled looks from the audience.

Before the Duke could complete his questionable performance, the King stepped forward, adopting a pious, remorseful tone. “Folks, let me be a warnin’ to y’all. I once was lost, a ferocious pirate upon the seven seas, takin’ what weren’t mine, until the good Lord saw fit to enlighten me.”

The crowd looked between the two men, confusion dawning on their faces. The King played his part well, invoking tears and gasps from the more gullible members. "This here be my trial,” he continued, eyes shimmering with feigned sorrow. “I come to y’all with nuthin’, leavin' my wicked ways behind, seeking redemption and y'all’s kind generosity.”

At first, the crowd seemed to be buying the act. Coins and bills started appearing in the collection plates as the preacher, moved by the proceedings, urged his flock to contribute to the King’s salvation. Huck and I exchanged anxious glances, knowing this wouldn’t hold.

Then, the King made his fatal mistake. “In my plunderin’ days, I encountered many a villain, from wenches to rabbis, all driven by greed and false idols—”

The crowd's friendly murmur dulled to a tense silence. The preacher’s eyes narrowed, his towering form stiffening with realization. “Rabbis?" someone in the congregation echoed. "But aren’t they supposed to be scholars?”

The King’s lack of comprehension was all too evident as he fumbled to backtrack. “Well, you know, everybody evil in their own way...”

The unraveling started. Faces in the crowd shifted from reverent to suspicious, murmurs growing louder.

“That don’t sound right,” a broad-shouldered man in the front row said. His voice carried a weight of authority, silencing the tentative whispers. “Rabbis ain’t no villains. They’s men o’ wisdom. You talkin’ nonsense, old man.”

The Duke, sensing the danger, tried to intervene. “Good sirs, ‘tis but a misunderstanding. My compatriot here misspoke—”

“Naw, he’s lying!” another voice called from the back. “If he’s lyin’ 'bout this, what else he lyin’ 'bout?”

The preacher stepped forward, fists clenched. “You’ve taken the Lord’s name in vain, swindled in His house. A pious pirate and a Shakespearean fool, huh?” His voice thundered. “Y’all ain’t nothin’ but charlatans!”

The crowd’s mood darkened ominously, the atmosphere now charged with hostility. Coins were snatched back, angry demands for return and justice escalating in volume.

“Hang ‘em!” someone shouted, the rallying cry quickly picked up by others.

Panic set in. The King and the Duke, suddenly pale, backed away from the hostile throng.

Huck and I edged toward the back of the crowd. "We gotta get outta here,” Huck urged, his eyes wide with fear.

“Follow me,” I instructed, grabbing his arm as we maneuvered through the chaos.

The preacher’s voice rose above the din. “– too far! We don’t abide liars and thieves. Grab ‘em! Make ‘em pay!”

My heart pounded as we finally broke free from the crowd, sprinting toward a narrow alleyway that led back to the river. We didn’t dare pause, the calls for retribution echoing in our ears as we slipped deeper into the town’s shadowy recesses.

Reaching the raft, we pushed off into the current, its gentle pull welcoming us back like a sanctuary from the madness we had just escaped. Huck and I collapsed onto the deck, breaths labored but relieved.

“We got away,” Huck gasped, eyes wide with the remnants of fear and adrenaline. “For now, anyway.”

My chest heaved as I scanned the river's horizon, already setting our next course. One thing was clear: the open water might hold dangers, but the land behind us was filled with greater perils.

In the dim light, under the expanse of the sky, we understood the journey of our bond and flight to freedom had only truly begun. We would have to navigate treacherous waters, deceitful companions, and hostile strangers, but together, we held a light—a simple, resilient hope that would guide us through the longest nights. The river, though unnerving, became a stubborn ally, carrying us forward into untold horizons wrapped in the whispers of dawn.## Chapter 20

# Chapter 21: Flickers in the Dark

A**BOVE THE BLINKING lights** of the town, a thin sliver of moonlight broke through the heavy darkness, a reluctant witness to our escape. The air clung to our skin, damp with the promise of a lingering storm. Huck and I moved in hurried silence, casting furtive glances over our shoulders. 

The town behind us was a tight knot of danger, its streets hiding treacherous shadows—a hunter’s ground. We'd seen the wanted poster for Jim plastered on a tavern wall, a stark reminder of just how precarious our situation was. Jim’s face, although crudely drawn, was unmistakable. The portrait's cold, unforgiving lines were etched with the bounty: three hundred dollars—a sum that could turn even the most decent man into a traitor.

“Jim, we gotta move faster,” Huck whispered, urgency in his voice.

I nodded. The Duke and the King would not hesitate to turn me in if they thought the reward was within their grasp. We darted down the narrow alleyways, our breaths loud in the silence, the wet cobblestones slick beneath our feet.

We plunged into the woods, seeking the whisper of the wind through the trees, the natural cover that had become a second home. Our footsteps were muffled by the thick undergrowth, each crunch of foliage a calculated risk. 

“We need to cover our tracks,” I said, glancing back at the faint glow of the town.

We worked quickly, sweeping branches over our path, doubling back, and weaving through dense groves. Finally, we reached the riverbank where our raft was hidden, a blessed sight waiting in the darkness. The raft was tied with a knot—secure, but difficult to untangle.

“Here, lemme get it,” Huck said, his small fingers deft with the ropes.

As he worked, my mind raced with the implications of our flight. Every moment spent here was another second too long, another chance for the Duke and the King to find us and turn the tables.

Then, shouts echoed through the forest. Familiar voices—insistent, desperate. The Duke and the King, calling for help. They must have discovered the poster and were after us, their tone laced with the lure of betrayal.

“They know 'bout the bounty,” Huck muttered, a grim understanding settling in.

“We ain’t gonna help ‘em,” I said firmly. “We risk everything if we do.”

Huck nodded. Experience had taught him the harsh lessons of trust and betrayal. He yanked the last of the knotted rope free, and we shoved off, the gentle current taking us into safer depths.

We drifted in silence, leaving the shouts behind. The river's dark embrace felt like a reprieve, its waters a cloak that separated us from the frantic terrors of the world.

* * *

**THE RAIN HAD FINALLY stopped**, leaving the world washed clean but teeming with an afterstorm chill. Huck and I stripped off our wet clothes, letting the cool night air set them to dry. The raft slowly rocked underfoot, an uneasy but rhythmic cradle.

Huck broke the silence, his voice soft. “Jim, 'bout those lies? The ones we told the Duke and the King?”

I looked at Huck, seeing the conflict in his eyes. “Sometimes lies can keep ya safe, Huck,” I replied, letting the truth settle between us. “But lies can also hurt.”

“I been lyin’ so much, it’s like second nature now,” Huck admitted. “What makes one lie better than another?”

His words were heavy, each one a step into the murky ground of conscience. “Not all lies be the same, Huck. Sometimes you lie to protect somebody. Other times, folks lie to protect theyselves, or to hurt someone.”

Huck nodded thoughtfully, staring at the sky. “What about the people hurt by truth, Jim? What if the truth does more harm?”

“The truth kin be a weapon or a shield, dependin’ on who holds it,” I said. “But sooner or later, it always comes to light. We gotta use it wisely. A man needs to know when to hold it back and when to let it free.”

Our clothes flapped lightly on the makeshift line. The conversation steered toward family—a raw seam in Huck’s young heart.

“I miss my Ma sometimes,” Huck confessed, his voice quiet. “Don’t remember much, but she was always kind.”

“I 'member her too,” I reminisced, my voice holding a tender reverence. “She was good folk. Always treated me like a human bein’, not just a slave.”

Huck's eyebrows furrowed. “How cain a person make another person a slave if they kind?”

“World be full of contradictions, Huck. Folks do things for reasons dey don’t understand, things taught to ‘em, handed down. Don’t make it right. Don’t make it less confusing.”

Huck was quiet for a moment, thinking deeply. “I don’t get why people can’t see beauty in each other, ‘stead of findin’ reasons to hate.”

“Beauty’s a powerful thing, Huck,” I replied. “It can bring joy or pain, freedom or chains. But true beauty lies in understanding, in seein’ each other clearly. The world’s a sight more beautiful when we can see past the scars and the chains.”

Huck nodded, the gravity of our shared reflections settling over us like a solemn prayer.

* * *

**SOMETIME ALONG OUR journey**, the horizon shimmered with an unnatural light, a flicker of disturbance against the dark. We turned our heads and saw it—a steamboat on fire, the flames licking hungrily at the night, casting an eerie glow over the waters.

The river was abuzz with activity, silhouettes of people scurrying frantically. The steamboat’s structure buckled under the roaring inferno, its booming voice replaced by the sharp crackle of fire feeding its primal appetite.

Huck and I watched, transfixed by the haunting spectacle. It was as if the boat were a living creature, writhing in its last moments, struggling to break free from the mortal bindings of the river and the flames.

“How quickly things can change,” Huck whispered, eyes wide. “One moment, it’s just a boat, and the next it’s—”

“A fiery prison,” I finished, my voice hushed. “Life kin turn in the blink of an eye, Huck. Today you afloat, tomorrow you ashore.”

The chaos across the river played out like a surreal dream, the figures on the boat appearing ghostly against the blaze’s consuming brilliance. Rescue efforts were a jumble of hurried movements, desperate cries mingling with the relentless roar.

We stayed silent, our raft gently floating away from the haunting image. The steamboat’s dying breath was a testament to life’s fragile nature, its impermanence echoing our own quests for freedom.

The river carried us further, the night folding back into its serene darkness, the flickers of the steamboat fire fading into a distant memory. Amid the ever-changing currents, Huck and I found solace in the simple rhythm of our journey, navigating the complex, ever-twisting lanes of life and freedom together.

In the quiet of the river’s embrace, we floated—two souls adrift, bound by shared experiences and the unyielding hope for a glimpse of dawn’s light, free from the shadows of pursuit. A dream of liberty etched in the gentle current, unwavering, as the mighty Mississippi forged onward, bearing our silent pledge to reach the far shore.## Chapter 21

# Chapter 22: The Bond of Pain

W**E HAD BEEN drifting** for what felt like forever, the Mississippi carrying us further from the chaos of the towns and the false security they offered. The air was thick with anticipation, each breath a cautious gulp against the uncertainty that loomed over us. Huck and I had been taking refuge in the dense brush by the river, hidden from prying eyes as the sun rose to its fullest height. The day's warmth was waning as we decided to venture out, our minds set on the false hope of some tranquility.

Emerging from the blankets of leaves and branches, we made our way back to the raft, eager to resume our journey down the endless river. But the sight that met us stole the breath from our lungs—the Duke and the King, wicked smiles etched on their faces, planted firmly on our raft. Their presence was like a dark cloud seeping through the calm.

"What y'all doing here?" Huck demanded, his voice steady, but I detected the tremor of fear beneath it.

The Duke stood, hands on his hips, surveying us with an air of triumphant arrogance. "Ain't it obvious, boy? We realized there's a profitable asset right under our noses," he sneered, eyes flickering toward me.

The insinuation cut deep, a stark reminder of the fragile thread on which my freedom dangled. "Y'all got no right to be here," I said, trying to keep my voice even, knowing that any sign of weakness would give them leverage.

The King stepped forward, his tall frame casting a long shadow over us. "Oh, Jim, but we do. You see, y'all ain't no match for seasoned gentlemen like us. We've devised quite the plan," he announced, a sinister gleam in his eye. "We’s gon’ sell ya, Jim. Over and over again. Each time, we'll secure the bounty, let ya run, and rinse and repeat."

Shock and terror gripped me like iron chains. This wasn't just a scheme; it was a living nightmare. The Duke chimed in, "And don't think about tryin' to get away, either. We'll call the authorities ourselves if ya give us any trouble."

Huck stepped forward, his small frame a fierce bulwark of defiance. "Jim ain't your property!" he shouted. "He’s comin' with me, and y'all's not gonna touch him!"

Both men laughed, the sound harsh and condescending. "Oh, ain't that cute? The boy thinks he owns a slave," the Duke mocked, sarcasm dripping from his tone. "Sorry, sonny. The law says minors can't own nothin', much less a runaway nigger."

The Duke's words hung in the air like a toxic miasma. I locked eyes with Huck, seeing his frustration and the helplessness that mirrored my own. The Duke unbuckled his belt, drawing it slowly, the leather hissing through the loops like a venomous snake poised to strike.

"I think it's time we teach this nigger some manners," the Duke declared, taking a menacing step toward me.

Before I could react, Huck darted in front of me. "No! You can't do this!" he pleaded, his voice cracking with desperation.

"Oh, I can," the Duke retorted coldly, pushing Huck aside. My heart pounded in my chest as the belt swung through the air, the first blow landing across my back with a sickening thud. Pain ripped through me, but I clenched my jaw, refusing to cry out.

"Pull down your pants, boy," the Duke growled.

I stared at him, defiance burning in my eyes. "No," I said, my voice unwavering.

The Duke's fury flared. He struck again and again, the leather biting into my flesh. Each lash was a denial of my humanity, a searing reminder of the powerlessness that defined my existence.

"Doesn't even feel it, does he?" the Duke sneered, his eyes wild with malevolent glee. "A nigger ain't human, after all."

The King, growing anxious, called out, "Don't damage him too much. We need him in good condition to sell."

But the Duke was beyond reason, his cruelty unleashed. "Oh, he can take it," he spat, raising the belt for another blow.

Huck's voice broke through the haze of agony, a desperate cry that pierced the night. "Stop it! Stop it, please!"

The Duke turned his venomous gaze on him. "You want a taste too, boy?" he hissed, sending a shiver of fear through Huck.

Huck stood his ground, tears streaming down his face. "Leave him alone!" he shouted, but his plea fell on deaf ears.

Through the searing pain, I felt a strange sense of pride. Huck, this young boy, was willing to stand up for me, to fight against the injustice that had defined my life. And as each lash of the belt struck home, I knew that our bond was forged in the fires of shared suffering.

The Duke didn't relent. Each strike was a brutal reminder of the world’s cruelty, the oppressive chains that bound us. But through it all, I held on to the slivers of hope—the dreams of freedom for Sadie, Lizzie, and me.

Finally, the Duke, satisfied with his brutality, threw the belt aside. The pain was overwhelming, my back aflame with it, but I stayed silent, my pride unbroken.

The King approached, a calculating look in his eyes. "Y'all know what y'en done? This here boy, this runnin' ain’t no good. Yer a liability." His words were a threat, hanging like a sword above us.

Huck moved to stand beside me again, his hand on my shoulder, a symbol of solidarity. “We ain’t going back, and y’all ain’t takin’ him nowhere,” he declared, his voice firm despite the trembling.

* * *

**THE NIGHT GREW darker**, the Mississippi’s waters a somber witness to our predicament. I lay on the raft, my body throbbing with pain, but my spirit unbowed. Each breath was a struggle, but Huck’s presence beside me was a balm for the soul.

“You alright, Jim?” Huck asked, his voice laced with worry.

I managed a nod. “It’s nothin' they can break,” I whispered, summoning a faint smile. “We gonna keep fightin’, Huck. Together.”

He grasped my hand, his small palm warm and reassuring. “I promise, Jim. I won’t let them hurt you no more.”

In the quiet darkness, as the river carried us toward an uncertain future, the bond between Huck and me was stronger than ever. Each gust of the night wind was a promise—a promise of freedom, of a life beyond the pain, of a day when the chains would fall away.

The moon hung high, a sentinel over our silent vows. We would press on, our hope unbroken, carried by the current toward the dawn.

For in the end, it was more than a fight for survival; it was a quest for dignity, a claim to the humanity we both deserved. And with each stroke of the water, we edged closer to that elusive shore, our spirits rising with the promise of a new day.## Chapter 22

# Chapter 23: Silent Pacts

A**S THE FIRST LIGHT** of dawn crept along the horizon, casting a fragile glow over the river, Huck and I ventured to the muddy banks of the Mississippi. The air was thick with tension. We knew that our presence, however temporary, was tenuous. But for now, we focused on the task at hand—catching catfish for breakfast.

The Duke and the King were nearby, their voices an irksome reminder of the peril that bounded us. They hovered, discussing their plans to sell me in the nearby town that straddled the borders of Missouri and Illinois. I could see the greed flicker in their eyes, a ravenous hunger masquerading as casual conversation.

Huck glanced my way, his face etched with concern. I eased down on a rock, careful not to put weight on my injured leg. The reminder of the Duke's beating was a throbbing testament to our dangerous predicament. Huck cast a line into the water, his movements brisk and tense.

"How ya holdin' up, Jim?" he asked softly, avoiding the wary gazes of our captors.

"I'll manage, Huck," I replied, gritting through the pain. "We gotta keep our heads clear, find a way outta this."

Huck nodded, casting furtive glances toward the Duke and the King. The sun had not yet fully risen, but the light was bright enough to reflect off the water, casting an ethereal glow over our precarious gathering.

The Duke peered over his shoulder, his voice oily with feigned nonchalance. "Catch us some good fish now, boys. We’ve got a big day ahead of us." His smug tone made my skin crawl. It took everything in me to stay calm, to keep my hands from shaking with anger.

“Yessuh,” I muttered, hiding the seething fury beneath my breath.

* * *

**WITH DUE TENSION**, we approached the outskirts of the town by mid-morning, the small settlement a patchwork of dilapidated shacks and robust wooden buildings. The streets were sparsely populated, but the eyes that watched us carried suspicion and curiosity.

"Keep yer pace, boy," the King snapped at me, his eyes cold and calculating. "Don't show no signs of weakness. You need to fetch a good price."

"Yessuh," I gritted out, keeping my limp subtle but present, feeling the distant hope stretch thin within me. My injured leg was an ever-present reminder of the looming danger, and I needed to mask it for now, to play their game until the moment of escape arose.

Huck walked beside me, the façade of fear giving way to the steely resolve that simmered beneath his young exterior. Together, we obeyed, every step a calculated move on this dangerous board.

As we neared the town’s central hub, the Duke and the King glanced around furtively before entering a saloon, leaving Huck and me under strict instruction not to move an inch.

From the vantage point near the saloon, we could hear the clinking of glasses and the rough laughter of its patrons—a stark contrast to the silent pact of survival that bound us together outside. Huck turned to me, his voice low and urgent.

"We gotta run, Jim. Ain't no way we can trust ‘em.”

"But how?" I asked, feeling the weight of my injured leg. "We ain't got much time, and there's eyes everywhere."

"We need a solid plan," Huck replied thoughtfully, his young mind furrowed with the weight of sudden responsibility. "We can't afford to be caught.”

Just then, the door of the saloon swung open, and a drunk man stumbled into the light, his eyes bleary and unfocused. He leaned against the wall, swaying with the rhythm of inebriation.

Huck seized the opportunity, stepping forward. "Mister, d'you happen to know where the Mississippi River is? We need to find our way back," he asked, voice polite and careful.

The drunk man squinted at Huck, his head tilting as he tried to process the question. "The river?" he slurred, weaving slightly. "It's... that-a-way." He pointed to the left, then right, seemingly having no clear sense of direction. "Or maybe... that-a-way." He pointed vaguely toward the town center, then back to the forest.

Huck and I exchanged a quick, puzzled glance. The drunkard’s directions were a tangled mess of confusion. "Thank you," Huck said, attempting to mask his frustration. The man, satisfied he had been useful, stumbled back against the wall and began snoring.

As silence settled over us, our minds raced. The directions were useless, but the urgency to act remained. We huddled close, our whispers carried by the wind. The Mississippi lay somewhere beyond the town, but an accurate path eluded us.

"We need a distraction," Huck mused. "They'll be lookin' for an easy sale. Maybe while they’s busy, we can sneak out to the raft."

"Ya sure we kin make it unnoticed?" I asked, my skepticism tinged with hope. 

"We ain’t got no other choice," Huck replied, his face set with determination.

Sitting on the edge of town, listening to the muted sounds of people living their lives, I let my thoughts drift to Sadie and Lizzie. The urgency to find freedom for my family weighed heavy on my heart. Running was not enough; we needed a foolproof plan—one to escape just more immediate danger and a path to genuine liberty.

"I wonder, Huck," I said quietly, my voice burdened with morning’s light and the encroaching shadows of noon. "What makes a man truly free? Is it just runnin', or is it findin' peace beyond da run?"

Huck looked at me, the weight of our collective struggles reflected in his eyes. "Guess we'll find out together, Jim. Guess we'll find out together.”

And with that, standing on the cusp of another harsh decision, we knew that our journey was far from over. The current of our lives demanded more than flight; it required courage, strategy, and the unyielding hope that dawn could bring—a sunrise that glimmered with the promise of freedom.## Chapter 23

# Chapter 24: Chains and Trust

T**HE RIVER WHISPERED** its gentle lullaby, but the day’s ceaseless pounding left us weary and uncertain. Huck and I dozed off outside the saloon, the hard wood of the bench scraping against our tired frames. The shadows of the Duke and the King loomed over us, their voices breaking through the haze of sleep.

“Get up, you two,” the Duke commanded, his voice sharp and unyielding. “We’re moving to the livery for the night.”

The King grabbed Huck by the arm, pulling him roughly to his feet. I struggled to stand, my injured leg protesting with a wave of pain. The night air was cool, offering little comfort as we trudged through the streets, the Duke and the King leading the way with a false air of authority.

The livery stood at the edge of town, its wooden structure creaking with age. An old blacksmith named Easter greeted us, his hands rough and calloused, yet his eyes held a softness that seemed out of place in a world so hardened by cruelty.

“Them two is bound to cause trouble,” the King said to Easter, pointing at Huck and me. “They need shackling.”

“What fo’?” Easter asked, his voice low and cautious.

“Just do it,” the Duke snapped, his impatience bleeding through.

Easter nodded reluctantly, reaching for the heavy iron shackles. Huck’s eyes flashed with defiance, but he stayed silent, his jaw clenched tight. Easter’s hands were steady as he placed the shackles around our wrists and ankles, the cold metal biting into our skin.

“I ain’t no criminal,” Huck muttered, the words barely audible.

“Hush, boy,” the King hissed, his eyes narrowing. “You’ll do as you’re told.”

Once the Duke and the King left, their footsteps fading into the distance, Easter moved closer, his eyes scanning the shadows. He produced a small key from his pocket, pressing it into my hand with a furtive glance. “Remove the shackles once they gone. Sleep more comfortably.”

“Thank ya, Easter,” I whispered, my voice laced with gratitude.

Easter gave a small nod, his gaze lingering on Huck. “Trustin’ a white boy like him? You sure ‘bout that?”

I met his eyes, my resolve unwavering. “Huck be different. He’s my friend. He’s helped me more than anyone else.”

Easter’s expression softened, the lines of his face less harsh in the dim light. “Be careful, Jim. World been hard on folks like us. Ain't ever kind.”

“I knows,” I said, feeling the weight of his words. “But Huck’s different.”

Huck stirred, his eyes fluttering open. He caught the tail end of our conversation, his face a mix of confusion and hurt. “Jim, why you talkin’ like that? Why you sound so...different?”

I sighed, the weight of explanation settling on my shoulders. “Huck, people act different ‘round each other. Talkin’ different be survivin’ sometimes.”

Huck’s eyes searched mine, the confusion slowly giving way to understanding. “You mean like how Miss Watson talks to her friends?”

“Exactly,” I said, nodding. “Sometimes, we gots to wear masks to protect ourselves. It don’t mean we ain’t friends. Just means we gotta be careful.”

Huck’s face softened, a small smile creeping across his lips. “I get it, Jim. Just didn’t know you had to do that.”

I reached out, placing a hand on his shoulder. “I trust ya, Huck. You’s been more of a friend than I could ever ask for.”

Huck’s eyes brightened, the hurt replaced with a newfound understanding. “And you’s been the best friend I ever had, Jim.”

We shared a moment of silent camaraderie, each word unsaid carrying the weight of our bond. The shadows of the livery stretched long into the night, but within the dim light, we found a small piece of sanctuary.

As Huck and I settled back against the hay, the silence between us held a new depth. The world outside was harsh and unforgiving, but within the quiet moments, we forged a connection that no chain could break.

Huck’s breathing steadied, and I allowed myself to relax, the dull ache of my leg a reminder of the pain but also of the hope that drove us forward. Together, we would navigate the treacherous waters, our trust in each other the compass guiding us through the darkest nights.

The Mississippi’s song lulled us into a restless slumber, the promise of dawn whispered in the gentle current. And as the night held its breath, we knew that our journey was far from over, but our friendship was a light that would never waver.

In the stillness of the livery, amid the flickering shadows, Huck and I fell into a fitful sleep, the shackles of the world held at bay by the unspoken pact that bound us together.

Tomorrow would bring new challenges, but for now, we rested—with hope, trust, and the shared dream of freedom etched deep within our hearts.## Chapter 24

# Chapter 25: Shackles of Trust

B**Y THE GREY LIGHT** of dawn, the tension hung thick in the air. Huck and I were on the brink of the unknown, sitting on the cold, hard floor of the livery. The Duke and the King, their shadowy figures cast long on the wooden walls, were murmuring in low tones at the entrance. Easter was tending to the forge, the heat from the embers painting eerie shapes across his weary face. 

Huck shot me a look, his young eyes troubled and searching. I gave him a tight nod, silently reassuring him that we would find a way—somehow—to navigate the treacherous waters before us. The Duke turned suddenly, eyes narrowed as he approached.

"Well, what do we have here?" he sneered, noticing we were unchained. "You boys been up to no good, I reckon."

Before we could respond, the King entered with a swagger, his dark eyes glittering with malevolence. "You neglected your duties, Easter," he accused, stepping closer to the old blacksmith. “What, think you could just ignore our orders?”

Easter raised his calloused hands. "Naw, suh. I..."

"Don't lie to us!” the Duke snapped, striking Easter across the face with the back of his hand. The sound echoed in the confined space, and I felt my chest tighten with fear and anger.

"I unchained Jim," Huck declared suddenly, standing to his feet with a stubborn set of his jaw. “Weren’t no fault of his.”

The Duke spun on him, fury overriding any semblance of his earlier composure. “You little whelp,” he spat. “Think you’re smart? Trying to outfox us?” He yanked a belt from his waist, and barely gave Huck a moment before swinging it down on Easter, punishing the innocent.

“No!” Huck cried, rushing forward, but the King pushed him back, laughing.

Easter took the whipping silently, a grim resignation in his eyes. With each lash, I felt a piece of my own spirit flinch. This wasn’t right—none of it.

A sudden voice from the back of the livery cut through the chaos. Deep and authoritative, it demanded attention. “What in tarnation is going on here?”

A tall, broad-shouldered man with a full white beard strode towards the commotion. His presence was commanding. I heard Huck whisper under his breath, “Wiley.”

The Duke hesitated, his grip on the belt loosening. The King’s bravado faltered, retreating a step. Easter’s owner had arrived, and the balance of power shifted subtly in the room.

“Who are you two to lay hands on my property?” Wiley’s voice boomed, eyes narrowing on the conmen. Easter, breathing heavily, looked up at him with a mixture of relief and fear.

"We’ve an arrangement," the Duke began, attempting to regain some semblance of control. "Can’t have slaves running around unchained, now, can we?"

Wiley’s gaze hardened. "From where I stand, only thing I see is you whooping a man under my roof," he growled. "You better have a damned good reason."

Huck, quick to seize the opportunity, stepped forward. "Jim’s with me. They don’t own him."

The King scoffed, masking his earlier fear with arrogance. "That boy’s out of his depth. The nigger belongs to us."

Wiley’s eyes flickered with a dangerous glint. “Ain’t no place for liars here. This black man will work for me from now on,” he declared. “You two best be movin'."

The Duke fumed, his face red. "You can’t just—"

"Enough!” Wiley barked. "I’ve spoken. Jim stays here. You two be gone."

Reluctantly, the Duke and the King stepped back. Their frustration was palpable, their schemes unraveling. “We’ll be back,” the Duke hissed at me. “Don’t think you can run."

As they turned to leave, the King’s eyes landed on Huck. His expression darkened with an almost tangible malevolence. “The boy comes with us,” he announced, grabbing Huck’s arm.

“No!” Huck yanked back, but their grip was unyielding, pulling him towards the door. Huck’s eyes met mine, wide with despair.

“They’ll kill him!” I shouted, stepping forward, the chains around my ankles rattling.

Wiley sauntered forward, his presence imposing. “You take him. But be warned, harm him, and you’ll answer to me.”

The Duke’s triumphant smile sent a chill down my spine. They pulled Huck away. I met his eyes one last time—they held a desperate plea and unwavering trust.

The echo of their footsteps faded, and the room fell into a strained silence. Easter, still hunched in the corner, looked up at Wiley, who gave a slow nod. “Settle him down,” Wiley instructed softly, motioning toward me. 

I sank down, letting the fear seep out of my drenched and exhausted body. Easter came over and took a knee beside me, gently helping me up. The air was thick with unspoken words—of trust, pain, and the understanding that we were all caught in a story much larger than ourselves.

As darkness settled over the livery, I felt a new resolve forming. Huck was out there, facing dangers I could only imagine. But I wouldn’t let despair take root. Our bond, our shared journey, was stronger than any chain or threat. We would find each other again and continue our quest for freedom—no matter the cost.

Wiley’s eyes met mine, a silent pact forming between us. “Work hard," he said gruffly. “We’ll see you make it out of here.”

In the quiet, I felt a flicker of hope. The Mississippi’s currents pulled at my spirit, whispering promises of a dawn yet unseen. Together, Huck and I would survive this storm, guided by the unwavering light of friendship and the enduring hope of liberation.## Chapter 25

# Chapter 26: Blacksmith Blues

T**HE LIVERY SEEMED** ancient, holding the air of stories whispered within its weathered walls. The memory of Huck being pulled away gnawed at my thoughts, but the present moment demanded my attention. Wiley had given his orders in a manner that brooked no argument, and as the sun spilled its early light through the cracks of the wooden structure, my day as a blacksmith began.

"Make yourself useful, Jim," Wiley had commanded, his presence like a dark cloud against the daylight. He pointed to the area where Easter was already at work, the fire in the forge casting an eerie glow that danced along the walls.

“Yes, suh,” I replied, masking my deeper thoughts. My place within these walls was both a prison and a potential sanctuary.

Easter’s eyes held a weary but welcoming look as I approached. His voice, when he spoke, carried the weight of countless hours spent in the sweltering heat of the forge. “C’mon now. I’ll show ya how it’s done,” he said, his tone a blend of gruffness and sympathy.

We began with the basics. Easter handed me a piece of iron, rough and unyielding. “First, ya need ta heat it up till it’s red-hot,” he instructed. His hands moved gracefully, defying their rough exterior as he demonstrated. “Then ya hammer it into shape. Simple, but takes a lot o’ muscle.”

I nodded, mimicking his movements, feeling the strain in my arms as I lifted the hammer and brought it down on the glowing metal. The rhythm was unfamiliar, a stark contrast to the soft motions tying together reed mats or plucking catfish from the river.

As the hours passed, my body began to find a rhythm amid the heat and the sound, my mind occasionally drifting to a pencil nestled securely in my sack. Easter’s voice broke the silence, a quiet seriousness in his words, “Ya gotta be careful with tha’ pencil, Jim. Ain’t nothin’ safe ‘bout it.”

I looked at him, puzzled. Easter’s cragged face seemed to soften slightly as he spoke. “There used ta be a man, Daniel, like us. Got caught wit’ a pencil, writin’ things down. They say he stole it.” He paused, eyes darkening with the memory. “Threw him up in a tree an’ left him hangin’. Jus’ ‘cause of that one small thing.”

The gravity of his words settled over me like a shroud. The small pencil, which had been a source of quiet empowerment, now felt like a double-edged sword—potential creativity intertwined with imminent danger.

“Daniel was a good man,” Easter continued. “But dat pencil cost him his life. So take heed. Be careful what ya do with it.”

The story churned in my mind as we worked. There was a balance between physical toil and the mental liberation drawn from writing. The weight of those dichotomies pressed upon me with each hammer stroke.

“I’ll be cautious,” I said softly, understanding the lesson Easter imparted.

“Good,” he murmured, returning to his work, the rhythmic pounding of metal on metal a steady cadence against the story’s backdrop.

* * *

**THE DAY HAD** stretched long, the heat of the forge relentless. Yet amid the suffocating warmth, I found a certain solace in the labor. My hands coordinated with a mind numbed enough to temporarily escape the more profound worries. The iron horseshoes gradually took shape under my hammer, a tangible sign of progress amid the intangible anxieties lurking in my thoughts.

Easter’s presence was calming, his guidance subtle but effective. He occasionally hummed a low tune, a soulful undercurrent to our work. The forge’s glow wrapped us both in its warm embrace, a temporary respite from the world outside.

“Ya got it, Jim,” Easter praised as I completed my first horseshoe. “Not bad for your first try.”

The simple accomplishment, small as it was, brought an unexpected sense of pride. It was a concrete marker of resilience, of maintaining my sanity and hope under the most trying circumstances.

Just as a semblance of normalcy settled over us, Wiley returned, his face critical as he examined our progress. “Not bad,” he acknowledged grudgingly, his eyes lingering on the horseshoes. Then he turned his gaze on me. “Sing while you work,” he demanded abruptly.

Singin’ had always been a way to cope—a blend of sorrow and hope carried on a melody. Easter gave me a small, reassuring nod as he began with a tune familiar to both of us. His gravelly voice led, and I followed, our voices merging in harmony.

“Oh, let the low clouds gather high,
We'll work and sing, my friends nearby,
In chains we toil, but spirits fly,
Through songs and memories, we’ll get by.”

The song filled the forge, a shared balm to the physical strain. Wiley watched silently, a slight smirk evident. The rhythm of our work continued, the music enveloping us, and for a fleeting moment, even the chains seemed lighter.

Then the unmistakable sound of approaching footsteps broke our reverie, a group of well-dressed men entering with grand flourish. Wiley’s eyes gleamed as he turned toward them, clearly anticipating their arrival.

Dressed in dark suits, white gloves, the Virginia Minstrels arrived like specters from another world, their presence both imposing and unsettling. Their leader, Daniel Decatur Emmett, stepped forward, his demeanor commanding attention. “Good day,” he greeted, his voice smooth but with an underlying edge.

Wiley greeted them with exaggerated enthusiasm. “Welcome, Mr. Emmett,” he said. “What brings you to my humble forge?”

Emmett’s gaze briefly settled on me before sweeping across the room. "We seek the finest blacksmiths for our show. Strong men with interesting stories."

The irony was sharp and bitter, the idea of turning pain and struggle into entertainment for the privileged. Easter’s grip tightened on his hammer, his eyes wary.

Emmett's smile never wavered. “We’ll recompense their owner fairly, of course,” he added, the veiled offer clear.

Wiley, always one for a profitable venture, nodded thoughtfully. “These two,” he gestured at Easter and me, “are worth their weight in gold. Strong and hardworking.”

I felt a mixture of fear and determination rise. The storm had arrived. Our fate lay not only in physical strength but in our ability to navigate the complex web before us.

“Prove their mettle,” Emmett commanded, crossing his arms. “Let’s see what these men are truly worth.”

Easter looked at me, the silent exchange carrying a world of understanding. Together, we set to work, every hammer blow an act of defiance, every song note a testament to our resolve. The Minstrels observed keenly, their judgmental eyes heavy upon us.

The day pressed on, each swing of the hammer, each swell of our song, a stand against the looming shadows. The Mississippi’s currents beckoned, a reminder of uncharted freedom, its whispers blending with our work, urging us forward.

In the fading light, amid the smoky haze, the shared pain and resilience of two enslaved men forged something more substantial than any iron horseshoe—a silent agreement to protect our dreams and defy the oppressive reality.

The river outside flowed steadily, an unrelenting testament to nature’s path. Just as the currents of the Mississippi persisted, so did we, in our pursuit of a life unshackled—carving rhythm and purpose in a world governed by injustice.## Chapter 26

# Chapter 27: Blackened Mask

B**Y MID-MORNING**, the livery was a bustle with the rhythmic clang of metal on metal. Each time the hammer fell, it sent a shiver through the air, echoing the unspoken hopes and fears held close to our chests. The breath of the forge, hot and insistent, distorted the scene like a mirage and blurred our reality, and within the hazy sight, unspoken truths lingered between us.

Wiley, ever the authoritative presence, entered the forge with purpose. He wore an unreadable expression, his eyes darting toward me and then back to Daniel Decatur Emmett, who looked slightly out of place among the gritty surroundings with his polished appearance. Emmett had arrived with the rest of the Virginia Minstrels not long ago, their pristine attire stark against the grime and labor of the forge. 

I felt a gnawing discomfort settle in my bones; my time here seemed borrowed. There was an air of finality about to unfold. It was not long before the heavy silence was broken by the conversation between two men of power.

“We need a tenor with a strong voice, someone who can command the crowd,” Emmett began, his voice carrying over the din. “And your man here seems to have just the voice we’re looking for.”

Wiley glanced at Emmett, the corner of his mouth twitching as if caught between a smile and a grimace. “Jim’s strong, no doubt 'bout it. But he’s more used to workin’ the forge than performing on stage.”

“Precisely why he’s perfect,” Emmett pressed on, his voice buttery smooth. “Others might try to overdo it, but Jim has the raw quality we need. His singing can be refined, molded. For someone as talented as him, I’m willing to offer two hundred dollars.”

The words hung in the air, heavy with their implication. Two hundred dollars was no small sum, even for a man like Wiley. His gaze fell on me, an appraising look that sent chills through my spine. 

A slight furrow creased Wiley’s brow as he glanced back at Emmett, uncertainty flickering across his features. “He’s worth more than just money, though I could use the coin,” Wiley mused, his tone contemplative. 

Emmett seized the moment, stepping closer. “Think of it as investing in talent. He’ll be well looked after, and his voice will bring more to the Virginia Minstrels than just entertainment—it will bring authenticity.”

Wiley nodded slowly, the offer clearly weighing on him. He turned to Easter, who stood nearby, concern etched on his weathered face. “Go fetch the paper and ink,” Wiley instructed, his voice carrying a finality that sealed my fate.

Easter hesitated for a moment, his eyes meeting mine, a silent acknowledgment of the helplessness that bound us both. With a reluctant nod, he hobbled over to the corner where the supplies were kept.

The room felt smaller, the air heavier as Easter returned with the items. I watched Wiley’s rough hand scrawl my name onto the bill of sale, each stroke like a chain tightening around my soul. Emmett’s satisfaction was evident as he pocketed the document, a greedy smile playing on his lips.

“And that’s that,” Wiley said, handing the bill of sale to Emmett. “He’s yours now.”

Emmett turned towards me, extending his hand with an exaggerated flourish. “Welcome to the Virginia Minstrels, Jim,” he said, his tone falsely warm.

I stared at his outstretched hand, feeling a mix of anger and resignation. The cold metal of his handshake felt like a shackle, but I grasped it nonetheless. The other members of the Minstrels clapped me on the back, their gestures ostentatiously friendly yet empty of real warmth.

I exchanged a final look with Easter, our silent bond forged in the heat of the forge. For a moment, his eyes held mine, an unspoken promise of endurance. My soul stirred, a fire ignited by the camaraderie and mutual understanding we shared.

“Remember what I said 'bout the pencil, Jim,” Easter whispered, his voice trembling as it struggled against the weight of the moment. “Write your story, but stay careful.”

With a heavy heart, I nodded, the pencil now a burden of responsibility. What started as a small act of defiance had grown into a fleeting lifeline. Its weight sat heavy in my pocket, a testament to the hopes carried by men whose voices were often silenced.

The day grew hotter, the sun pressing down on us as Emmett began to lead me out of the livery stable. Each step was laden with uncertainty, but Huck’s face flashed in my mind. His youthful defiance, his unwavering support—it all fueled my resolve.

As I walked away from the livery with the Virginia Minstrels, my thoughts spiraled. The realization hit me like a punch to the gut—I had been sold without a word of my own. I was a commodity, bartered as easily as a horse or a plow. My desires, my dreams, my very essence were disregarded.

But one thing remained clear: however deep the sale had cut, it hadn’t destroyed my spirit. Within the folds of this new, uncomfortable costume they would make me wear, I harbored a secret flame. A voice not just for song, but for freedom. And with that, I walked on, shrouded in confusion but fortified by the unresolved hope of liberty.

As the livery disappeared behind us, the river's whispers reentered the fringes of my mind, both a source of solace and relentless reminders. My journey continued, with new chains yet the same unyielding dream etched deep within my soul. Amid the rising clamor of the minstrel troupe around me, the melody of freedom hummed quietly—a persistent, steadfast song.## Chapter 27

# Chapter 28: Performing Shadows

T**HE COFFEE SMELLED** better than it tasted, but beggars couldn’t be choosers. Cassidy handed me a steaming tin mug as we sat around the makeshift campfire. The aroma mixed with the earthy scent of the surrounding woods, a small comfort amid a sea of uncertainties. The Virginia Minstrels’ camp was an odd oasis—a blend of tents and wagons, instruments resting against tree trunks. The troupe members moved about with a practiced ease, their quick glances at me tinged with curiosity and the weight of unspoken stories.

Cassidy settled beside me, folding his lanky frame into a semblance of comfort on the ground. “Coffee’s strong, but it’ll wake you up,” he said, his voice carrying the warmth of casual camaraderie. He pointed to a trombone resting nearby. “That’s my friend there,” he said, a smile quirking up one corner of his mouth. “Name’s Cassidy, by the way.”

“Jim,” I replied, wrapping my hands around the mug, letting the warmth seep into my bones. The simplicity of his introduction sparked a mix of emotions—gratitude, suspicion, confusion. These were not the faces of overseers nor the expressions of hatred, yet the power dynamics were unmistakable.

Emmett stood a few paces away, observing the camp with a discerning eye. His authority was clear, but there was a calculated kindness to him that made the lines blur. As he approached, the conversation lowered. “Jim, we need to clarify something,” he began, his tone measured. “You were hired, not bought. Understand? We’re not slavers, but we’re not abolitionists either. We oppose slavery; it’s... bad for business.”

The declaration left me grappling with the irony. Emmett’s words dangled the promise of something more humane, yet they sprang from the same roots of exploitation. Nodding cautiously, I felt the weight of my status shift—less a chain, more a leash.

The troupe began gathering, instruments in hand. “Time to learn some songs,” Cassidy said, patting me on the back. His ease felt disarming.

They started with “Ole Dan Tucker,” Emmett leading the ensemble. The melody had a jovial ring, its familiarity cutting through the strangeness. Cassidy and the others gestured for me to join in, their expressions encouraging. I found myself slipping into the tune, my voice tentatively aligning with the choruses.

“Jimmy Crack Corn” followed, its rhythm easier to catch, and they nodded approvingly as I fell into the refrains. Music had always been a language of its own—unifying, transcending barriers, yet here, it was also a tool, shaping identities, crafting a semblance of unity amid the discord.

As dusk settled, Cassidy handed me a bundle of clothes. The fabric was finer than anything I had worn before, clean but constricting. “Time to get you ready for the show,” he said, his tone warm but firm. Helping me change, he showed a kindness that left me uneasy, the intersection of genuine and performative kindness hard to decipher.

The trousers clung uncomfortably, the fabric chafing against my leg wounds. Every movement was a reminder of the pain beneath, a challenge to maintain the façade of normalcy.

Cassidy noticed my discomfort. “It’ll take some getting used to,” he admitted, adjusting my vest. “And remember, don’t button the bottom button. It’s a custom.”

Emmett observed the preparations, his eyes missing nothing. “We don’t have extra shoes, Jim,” he stated matter-of-factly. “You’ll perform barefoot. We’ll blacken your feet for the act.”

The suggestion turned my stomach. Blackening my feet wasn’t just a performance detail; it was a symbol, a marker of otherness. But I complied, knowing battles were chosen wisely.

Cassidy’s hands were gentle as he helped me with my tie, his movements practiced and methodical. “You’re doing good, Jim,” he said softly. “We’ll make sure you’re ready.”

The troupe watched approvingly as I stood, the new clothes a second skin I had yet to fully inhabit. It was a costume, a mask—but beneath it, I remained unwavering.

Music started up again, a twin to the fire’s flickers, shadows dancing in the night. “Let’s get some practice in,” Emmett called, the group falling into formation.

Harmonies filled the camp, voices and instruments blending into a cohesive unit. Each note, each step was a lesson in adaptability, a testament to resilience. For a brief moment, the night was a cocoon, the river’s distant whispers a lullaby rather than a warning.

As the last notes of “Jimmy Crack Corn” faded into the stillness, I looked around at the faces of the troupe—strangers united in song, diverse in their intents and stories. Cassidy’s eyes met mine, and in them, I glimpsed a flicker of understanding, an acknowledgment of my struggle, my guarded hope.

The river called once more, a reminder of the journey untouched, the freedom across its whispering currents. And though the path was obscured, the firelight showed the way—through performance, song, and the silent strength that bound me to this moment.

We were more than shadows under the night’s sky. We were stories untold, dreams unseen, performers of our destinies, shaping the rhythm of our song one note at a time, using every shared breath and every stolen moment of trust to carve our way toward the dawn.

The night wore on, each song a brick in the wall of my resolve, each gaze a silent pact to endure. The Mississippi’s echoes hummed in my bones, promising that even in the theatrical mirage of the minstrel camp, I would remain—Jim Golightly, unbroken and ever hopeful.## Chapter 28

# Chapter 29: Hidden Realities

T**HE SUN WAS JUST BEGINNING** its slow descent, casting long shadows across the makeshift camp of the Virginia Minstrels. The camp buzzed with a frenetic energy as performers readied themselves for the evening’s performance. My nerves tingled with a mix of anxiety and determination. This was an unexpected path, but I had to tread it carefully.

A man approached me, his steps confident yet guarded. His name was Norman, a member of the troupe who had a calm, unassuming presence. He carried a small tin of bootblack and a sponge, and he motioned for me to sit on a tree stump nearby.

“Jim, right?” Norman asked, his eyes meeting mine with a surprising amount of warmth.

“Yessuh,” I replied, falling into the practiced speech patterns that were expected of me. It was easier to maintain the facade than to risk exposing more than was safe.

Norman began applying the bootblack to my face with gentle, careful strokes. “This is gonna feel strange at first,” he said, his voice low and reassuring. “But you’ll get used to it.”

As he worked, Norman’s eyes flicked around the camp, ensuring no one was within earshot. Then, leaning in closer, he spoke in a whisper so soft it was barely audible. “I need to tell you something, Jim. I’m not who I appear to be. Few people know, but... I’m a black man passing as white.”

I froze, the implications of his admission sinking in. Norman’s skin was light enough to pass for white, his features carefully altered with makeup to erase any hint of his true ancestry. It was a dangerous reality that we both navigated, hidden beneath layers of appearance and survival.

“You mean…” I began, but he cut me off with a nod.

“Exactly. I’m in this just like you, though in a different way,” Norman continued, his hand steady as he added more bootblack. “This minstrel show is a strange thing. White performers mocking black folks, and yet what most people don’t realize is that these shows are actually white folks imitating how blacks mock whites. It’s an endless cycle of imitation and irony.”

The words hung heavy in the air between us. Norman was revealing a layer of complexity that I had never considered. This performance was not just a grotesque parody, but a reflection of deeper societal contradictions.

“They don’t know you’re the first black man knowingly in this troupe,” Norman said, his tone serious. “You’re replacing a tenor who... well, he left under mysterious circumstances. No one knows what happened to him.”

I nodded, absorbing the gravity of my situation. The role I was stepping into carried not just the weight of performance but the shadow of those who had come before me.

As Norman continued his work, smoothing the bootblack across my skin, Emmett approached, his keen eyes inspecting me closely. “Needs more makeup,” he declared brusquely, his fingers tapping against his chin. “Make him look... authentically black.”

Norman nodded, applying another layer with meticulous care, his eyes avoiding mine. “Just follow the cues, Jim. Don’t speak unless absolutely necessary. The songs are simple, and you’ll pick up on them quickly.”

Emmett’s gaze locked onto me, ensuring I absorbed every word. “Speak in the manner expected of you,” he instructed, his tone carrying an unspoken threat. “We want the audience to believe the illusion.”

I gave a slight nod. The performance was about more than singing; it was about maintaining a carefully crafted deception.

With the preparations complete, Norman took a step back, scrutinizing his work. “You’ll be fine, Jim,” he said quietly, his eyes meeting mine with a flicker of solidarity.

As the troupe gathered for final instructions, I stood there, the weight of the bootblack and the layers of my true self hidden beneath it. I turned to Norman, a question forming in my mind. “Do we ever get paid?” I asked, the possibility of earning money to buy my family’s freedom flickering like a distant, fragile dream.

Norman’s face grew somber. “Sometimes. But don’t count on it. They might use the promise of payment to keep you in line.”

Emmett called for everyone’s attention, his voice loud and authoritative. “Get ready, everyone! The show starts soon.”

Taking a deep breath, I prepared myself for what was to come. I had to navigate this performance carefully, each step a balance between visibility and invisibility.

Norman’s voice reached me one last time before we took our places. “Remember, Jim. Survival first. We’ll figure out the rest as we go.”

Nodding, I stepped forward, my voice adopting the cadence expected of me as I replied, “Yessuh, I understand.”

As the music began and the crowd settled in, I felt the weight of many eyes upon me. Tonight, I performed not just for the audience, but for the possibility of a future where these layers could be shed, where freedom was more than just a distant thought but a tangible reality.

And within the confines of this charade, my spirit remained unbroken, a testament to the enduring light of hope and resilience. Even as the shadows of performance enveloped me, I knew who I was beneath it all: a man determined to carve out his freedom one note, one song at a time.## Chapter 29

# Chapter 30: Performing Shadows

T**HE SUN HAD SET**, leaving the town bathed in the glow of gas lamps and flickering candles. The Virginia Minstrels, their laughter and chatter loud in the quiet of the night, marched down the main street. We were a gaudy parade, moving to the rhythm of a brass band and the high, sharp whine of a fiddle. I tried to focus on the music, on putting one foot in front of the other, but my mind was a whirl of conflicting thoughts.

My face darkened with layers of bootblack, my body clad in the fine clothes that marked me as part of the minstrel troupe. The absurdity of the situation gnawed at me. I was a fugitive under blackened skin and a borrowed voice, an unwilling minstrel in a grotesque dance through the heart of enemy territory.

The crowd gathered, a sea of white faces watching with eager anticipation. They laughed and clapped as we performed the cakewalk, a dance that was as much a mockery as it was a performance. My feet moved mechanically, my mind elsewhere, even as I pasted on a broad, fake smile.

As we entered the auditorium, the atmosphere shifted. The room was large, almost echoing, and its layout reminded me of a courtroom. The wooden benches were filled with an eager audience, and the stage was set for the performance. Emmett led us with a commanding presence, his eyes sharp, missing nothing.

The lights dimmed slightly, and the music began. We launched into the first song, our voices blending into harmonious notes. I kept my gaze fixed on the back of the stage, avoiding the faces in the audience. Their laughter, their applause—it was all a backdrop to the inner turmoil I hid beneath my polished exterior.

The songs flowed one after the other, each one a carefully crafted piece of theater. The audience's reactions were a mixture of amusement and indulgent superiority. I saw their smiles, their laughter, and I felt a churning mix of anger and sadness. They were entertained by the caricature I had become, ignorant or uncaring of the truth hidden beneath the layers of performance.

After what felt like an eternity, the final song ended, and the audience erupted in applause. Emmett bowed deeply, his smile wide and genuine. The troupe dispersed into the crowd, each member blending seamlessly with the audience, save for me.

Left alone and vulnerable, I made my way to the edge of the auditorium, seeking a moment of solitude. That’s when I felt a light touch on my arm. Turning, I found myself face to face with a white woman, her hand still resting delicately on my sleeve.

“Hello there,” she said, her voice soft but clear. “I’m Polly. I saw you perform; you were... remarkable.”

I blinked, taken aback by her candor. “Thank ya, miss,” I replied, the practiced dialect slipping easily into place.

She tilted her head, curiosity lighting her eyes. “Where are you from? Your travels must be fascinating.”

Her curiosity felt disarming, almost genuine. But before I could formulate a response, a large man stepped forward. He was Polly's father, his presence casting a long shadow over our interaction. His white beard and suit made him look like a strict guardian of propriety. His eyes, however, held a sharp disapproval.

“Polly,” he barked, his voice low and commanding. “What are you doing talking to this... this performer?”

Polly’s eyes darted to her father, a mix of fear and defiance in her gaze. “Father, he was part of the show. I’m just—”

“Enough,” he cut her off, his eyes narrowing as he looked me over. “What’s your name, boy?”

I felt a lump form in my throat, but before I could answer, Emmett appeared from the crowd, his presence diffusing some of the tension.

“Sir!” Emmett called cheerfully, stepping between Polly’s father and me. “This young man is part of our troupe. His name is... Jim.” He shot me a warning glance, then turned on the charm. “You’ve been watching our performance," he continued. "Jim here is quite the singer, don’t you think?”

Polly’s father frowned, suspicion clouding his eyes. “Something seems off about him. Why don't ya remove that wig, boy?”

A cold sweat began to drip down my back. Emmett seemed to anticipate this. With a practiced, disarming laugh, he said, “Oh, our Jim here? This is no wig, sir. Why, we pride ourselves on authenticity!” He ruffled my hair playfully, forcing a slight chuckle. Polly’s father didn’t look entirely convinced, but the crowd's proximity and the social atmosphere seemed to restrain his confrontation.

“Come along now, Polly,” he muttered finally. “Let's leave the performers to their business.” He grabbed her arm roughly, pulling her away.

As they left, Emmett’s smile faded. “That was too close. Keep your head down, Jim.”

Norman appeared at my side, his face pale. “Let’s get out of here,” he whispered urgently.

We slipped away from the crowd, blending into the shadows as we made our way back to camp. The night air was cool, a relief after the stifling heat of the auditorium. But anxiety gripped me, a constant reminder of the precariousness of my situation.

Once we reached camp, the atmosphere was tense. The troupe members moved about, their faces etched with worry and exhaustion. Emmett gathered us all, his voice commanding attention.

“Listen up,” he said, his tone serious. “Tonight was a success, despite the close call. But we need to stay cautious. Our safety depends on it.”

There were murmurs of agreement, but I felt a rising anger within me. Emmett’s words rang hollow, his intentions unclear. Was he truly concerned for our well-being, or was this just another layer of the performance?

Norman approached me, his face drawn. “Jim, we need to talk.”

We moved to the edge of the camp, away from prying ears. “I can’t keep doin’ this, Norman,” I admitted, my voice trembling with suppressed emotion. “It’s too dangerous. I need to find a way out.”

Norman nodded, his expression sympathetic. “I understand, Jim. But for now, we have to play along. We'll figure out a way, but it has to be safe.”

The night wore on, the fire crackling softly as we sat in silence. The Mississippi's ever-present whisper was a reminder of the journey ahead, the hope of freedom that kept me moving forward.

In the quiet darkness, I reflected on the complexities of my emotions. Anger, fear, and a flickering hope intertwined within me. Emmett’s true intentions remained a mystery, but I knew one thing for certain: I would not be broken by this charade. My spirit, though tired and tested, remained unyielding.

The road to freedom was fraught with danger, but with each step, each performance, I edged closer to my goal. And with allies like Norman and the silent strength of those who had come before me, I knew that I could endure.

As the stars blinked overhead, their light a distant echo of dawn's promise, I made a silent vow to myself. No matter the cost, no matter the obstacles, I would find my way to freedom—one note, one song, one step at a time.## Chapter 30

# Chapter 31: Wary Shadows

T**HE VEIL OF NIGHT** was thick and suffocating. My body ached from the forced dance that I had to perform under the constant gaze of judgmental eyes. The Virginia Minstrels were a circus of forced mirth, and I—under the layers of bootblack—had no choice but to play the jest. The darkness outside the tent cascaded like a waterfall, assisting in hiding my weariness. It had been a restless night. The murmurs of the troupe members and the rustling sounds of the forest melded together into a symphony of unease.

As the first light of dawn infiltrated the seams of the tent, I allowed myself a rare moment of vulnerability, drifting into a light sleep. But it was short-lived. The touch on my hair was sudden and intrusive, jolting me awake with a rush of dread surging through my veins.

**POLLY'S FATHER**, a formidable figure with a white beard and scrutinizing eyes, loomed over me. His presence was so forceful that even the gasps from the onlookers seemed to be swallowed by his shadow. "Boy, remove that bootblack now," he demanded, yanking my head back to get a better look at my hair.

My blood ran cold. I went to pull away instinctively, but his grip tightened. Words failed me as the scene seemed to unfold in agonizing slow motion. Emmett’s tent flap flew open, and the leader of the Virginia Minstrels stormed in. His eyes, sharp as a hawk’s, took everything in.

"Take your hands off him, sir," Emmett commanded, his voice a blend of authority and practiced civility.

Polly’s father, visibly vexed, turned toward Emmett, still gripping my hair. “What are you hiding here?” he seethed. “This boy is...”

"We are a professional troupe. You have no right to interfere with our business," Emmett shot back, stepping closer, his gaze unflinching.

Polly's father finally released his grip on me but maintained his accusatory tone. “This is Alabama, and we have strict laws. I'll call the sheriff!"

A dangerous silence hung in the air, charged with palpable tension. Emmett's face hardened. “Call the sheriff, and all you’ll find here is the wreckage of a tired ensemble trying to make an honest living. We have our ways, and you have yours.” His voice dropped lower, holding a faint but unmistakable hint of menace. "Be sure you're ready for the consequences."

The threat sliced through Polly’s father’s growing bravado. His face flushed with anger and something more—fear perhaps. “Mark my words,” he threatened, his eyes briefly locking with mine. “You’ll be answering for this deceit.”

Emmett remained unyielding, his gaze ice-cold. With a final huff of indignation, Polly’s father turned and stormed out of the tent, his heavy footfalls shaking the ground as he retreated.

**THE TENSE SILENCE** lingered like a foul odor. Emmett, asserting his control over the situation, instructed sharply, “Everyone, pack up. We leave immediately.” The urgency in his tone was unmistakable, and the troupe members quickly mobilized.

As we packed, Emmett approached me. For a moment, he removed his leader’s mask, revealing a glimpse of genuine regret. “Jim,” he began, hesitating as if choosing his words carefully. “I'm sorry you had to go through that."

His apology threw me. Did he truly regret putting me through this, or was it a ploy to maintain order within the troupe? I nodded, the confusion swirling within me.

We moved with practiced efficiency, each member of the troupe aware of the underlying urgency. Emmett’s eyes met mine. “Walk with me, Jim,” he said.

Following him, I could feel a peculiar mix of warmth and underlying tension in his voice. As we walked, Emmett began to hum a new tune, tapping his feet gently in rhythm. “Tell me, Jim, what do you think of this new song I’m working on?”

His question caught me off guard. “I’d need to hear all of it,” I began cautiously. “So far, it sounds... powerful.”

Emmett nodded, his gaze far away. “It’s called ‘Dixie’s Land.’ I want it to be something memorable, something that resonates.”

I hesitated before speaking. “Emmett... Can we talk about my status?”

He glanced sideways at me, his expression cautious. “You’re hired, Jim. Not a slave. Think of it as a contract. The $200 I paid for you, you’ll have to repay that through performances.”

“Two hundred performances,” I mused aloud. It hit me—each day, each song pushing me further toward an uncertain freedom. "How much each day?" I asked, trying to mask the urgency in my voice.

“One dollar a day,” Emmett responded. “It’s a fair wage for someone of your talents.”

I pondered, mulling over the practicality and implications of this new arrangement. 200 days equated to over half a year—a bond, yet different from the one of chains I had known before. “Emmett, why did you choose this path?” I finally asked, curiosity inching through my caution.

“For the art, Jim,” he replied simply. “But also for survival. We all do what we must to endure. Even you. Perhaps especially you.”

The moonlight and the unfurling dawn made his features murky yet palpable—enigmatic remains of man pulled in by circumstances and crafted commitments.

I watched the landscape outside shifting under the hues of breaking day. Each step on this path wasn't just marking time, but carving stories into the annals of a world always on the brink of change.

“So what is it, truly? The difference between chattel slavery and bonded slavery?” I asked softly, my words laced with weight.

Emmett's gaze finally met mine, a rare moment of shared understanding. "One binds the body, the other... the soul. Our task, Jim, is to free both—incrementally or instantly. With whatever means and songs we have."

As the ethereal dawn light embraced us, the Mississippi’s soft current murmuring in the distance, I found a renewed commitment forming within me. This bond, these chains, were shadows. Inside them, I would rise unfettered, voice crystalline, carving melodies unwavering.

In the sibilant symphony of the breaking dawn, echoes of freedom intertwined with every note, every breath. Even in shadows, hope sang.## Chapter 31

# Chapter 32: Escaping Shadows

T**HE LOGGING TOWN** loomed on the horizon like a mirage born from the relentless march through the thick, humid woods. The Virginia Minstrels and I had been traveling for hours, the heat pressuring beads of sweat down our backs while gnats and mosquitoes clouded around our faces, adding to the misery. Each step was a tender reminder of the blisters forming on my feet, the too-tight boots wrapped around them like a cruel embrace. As we approached the rough-hewn buildings of the town, I couldn't take it anymore. I stopped briefly, bending down to unlace the boots and slide them off, offering my sore feet a momentary reprieve.

The town itself was ragged, the people hard-bitten from years of labor. The distant sound of axes sinking into wood and the distant hum of saws slicing through logs filled the air, their song a dissonant counterpoint to our footfalls on the dusty road. My fellow troupers sauntered into town, voices hushed with the anticipation of money and drink. Emmett broke off from our group, heading toward the modest town hall to arrange a performance. The rest of us marched to the far side of town, pitching our tents in a small clearing near the edge of the forest.

Big Mike, one of the burlier men in the troupe, set up his tent beside mine. His easy-going indifference was a salve against the raw nerves exposed by our journey. He glanced at me as he pounded in the last tent stake. His movements were strong but bored, practiced from years of setting up and breaking down.

“So Jim,” Big Mike muttered, his voice low and gravelly, “what do you think about Emmett’s grand plans? All his talk about freeing slaves through music? Touching stuff, huh?”

The skepticism was clear in his voice. I shrugged, wiping sweat from my brow. “It’s... complicated,” I admitted, wanting to tread carefully. "Emmett believes it, I think. But believing don't change much for folks like me.”

Big Mike chuckled, squatting down to tie off a final rope. “Most folks don’t care about nothing but themselves,” he replied, a cynical edge coloring his words. “You, me, Emmett—we just play our parts in this big show.”

The words gnawed at me more than they should have. They encapsulated a disturbing truth that resonated deeply. Emmett’s veneer of benevolence hinged on performance and self-interest. Despite any sympathy or camaraderie, our bond was ultimately transactional.

After a few hours, Emmett returned, his face set in a mask of annoyance and determination. “This crowd ain’t no easy audience, Jim,” he said, his voice calm yet demanding. “They’re loggers, rough men who’ve been drinking all day. It’s dangerous.” He paused, his eyes narrowing. “I need you to stay behind, keep an eye on the camp.”

It was less about concern for my safety and more about the practicality of not risking his investment. I nodded, accepting my role without argument. As they prepared for the performance, I stayed back, my boots in hand, the pain in my feet a throbbing reminder of my confinement.

The minutes stretched into an hour. The sounds of bustling activity eventually faded as the troupe moved toward the town center, their voices swallowed by the distance. I took the moment of solitude to eat a rough heel of bread, my thoughts roiling behind a placid exterior.

With the troupe gone, I felt the weight of my situation pressing down, a dark cloud suffocating hope. I was a runaway twice over now. If caught, I’d not only face the terror of returning to slavery but Emmett’s wrath or worse. My mind raced, feeling the urgency of seizing this moment to escape.

Taking a few deep breaths, I made my decision. Padding silently to the supply tent, I snagged another loaf of bread, some hard cheese, and my old shoes. But there was more—Emmett’s leather notebook sat there, an emblem of control and authority. On a whim, I grabbed it. There might be details, something useful that could help me regain my freedom. The leather was cool against my palm, a false token of control in a life so dictated by others.

Yanking on my shoes, I ducked into the trees, heart pounding in rhythm with my footfalls. Each branch or rustle threatened exposure, the woods both sanctuary and trap. The smell of pine and earth filled my senses, the vastness of the forest weighing on me as I moved deeper into its embrace.

Running now, faster and faster, my mind jumped between past horrors and potential futures. My ankle felt each shuddering impact over years gone, memories laden with a desire to never look back. I was no longer just Jim—the runaway slave but Jim Golightly—a name and a man fighting against layers of identity to carve out truth. The moonlight filtered down, painting patches of light on the forest floor, guiding me with ghostly fingers.

Finally, I had to stop, knees buckling, panting heavily. My legs burned from the exertion. I found a dense thicket of bushes and crawled underneath, willing my breath to quiet. Silence fell, save for the night sounds of the woods—the hoot of an owl, the distant croak of frogs—it was a dangerous lull, giving way to contemplation.

I pulled out the bread and cheese, gnawing on them with gusto. Each bite seemed to fuel the rage and resolve within me. My mind churned with the implications of my escape. I was running towards an uncertain horizon, a world filled with promise and peril alike.

Reflecting on my journey, my thoughts were a tangled web. On one side, the shame and fury of my existence in this minstrel circus—a cruel mockery of lives beyond understanding. On the other, symbols and moments of fledgling freedom, ephemeral but potent. The oppressive complexity of my emotions mirrored the dense woods around me.

As my heartbeat settled, I considered my next steps. I needed a plan, a route that wouldn’t just lead me in circles but to true liberation. Emmett’s notebook might reveal such paths. Unfurling its pages cautiously, the leather-bound book felt oddly sacred. Among the notes of performance schedules and towns, there were cryptic entries, potentially valuable.

I wasn’t simply a character in others’ stories anymore; I had a narrative to script. I was Jim Golightly—no longer willing to dance in the shadowed theater of fate without contouring my silhouette.

Each calculated movement towards freedom was a note in our shared song—Huck, Sadie, Lizzie—our chords echoing harmoniously even when apart. The future lay somewhere on the horizon, hidden yet attainable.

As dawn began its gentle embrace, lifting shadows from my path, I rose from the bushes and set my gaze firmly ahead. Onward, I walked. My mind was steeled, my steps purposeful. The journey was unforgiving, but the river’s whisper promised a melody worth pursuing—one leading not through stage lights and deceptive bonfires but to freedom, resonant and true.

Through the forest’s threshold, each stride sang with the hope of liberation, one assured note at a time.## Chapter 32

# Chapter 33: Trust and Tensions

W**AKING UP IN THE WOODS** was both a blessing and a curse. The first light of dawn filtered through the thick canopy, casting dim patches of warmth onto my face and hands. The cool ground beneath me, still damp with dew, offered little comfort after the previous days of frantic movement. But the gnawing hunger in my belly was ignored by a sharper stimulus—footsteps.

At first, my instincts swore it was a nightmare. The soft crunching of fallen leaves and the faint rustling of bushes felt like ghosts of my restless sleep. Sitting up quietly, my heart pounded until the form of a figure approached.

"Norman?" I whispered, squinting through the shadows to see him. Relief washed over me, followed instantly by confusion.

"Jim. I finally caught up with you," Norman said, his voice breathless. He looked around nervously, his face slick with sweat, his boots caked with forest muck.

"What you doin' here?" I asked, brows drawn together in confusion. He was supposed to be back with the Virginia Minstrels, blending in among the blackface actors, perpetuating their performance. Yet here he was, looking like a man on the run.

Norman sat down heavily beside me, glancing back the way he'd come. "Emmett was furious when he found out you had gone," he explained, his voice trembling. "He threatened to hunt you down personally. Said you were his prized performer and that he wouldn't let you just walk away."

My heart sank. The idea of Emmett tracking me sent a shiver down my spine. "So you ran too?"

"I had to," Norman replied fiercely. "Emmett suspects—he has some idea, or he's close to figuring out about me. I couldn’t stay. You know… 'bout my true identity."

For a moment, the woods felt like they were closing in on us, but I realized there was no time to lose. "We need to come up with a plan," I said abruptly. "This wasn't just gonna end with us on the run. We need to turn this situation 'round."

Norman looked at me, his tired eyes scanning my face. "What do you have in mind?"

I took a deep breath. "What if you were to sell me, over and over? The money we make—each time, it goes to buyin' freedom: mine, yours, and our families'."

Norman’s eyes widened, horror and intrigue mingling. "That's... insane. It's so dangerous, Jim. You know what they'll do to you if they catch on."

"We don't have much of a choice," I replied, my voice steady. "Each sale, each town, it's a chance. We keep movin', so no one's the wiser 'bout us revisitng the same plan. You sell me, we get the money, I escape, and we move on."

Norman sighed, looking defeated. "Alright, but we need to be smart about this. If we go wrong even once, it could be the end for us both."

Together, we stood and started making our way to a nearby creek. Norman paused to wash off the heavy layers of makeup, transforming back into his natural self. As the blackface and grime sluiced off, a stark contrast emerged—his lighter skin a shield rather than an identity, a mask that the world allowed to pass.

"We'll need new names," I said, watching as Norman rinsed away the remnants of his performance. "Every town will need a different story."

Norman nodded, his eyes glinting with determination. "This creek runs south for a while then meets the river. We'll follow it. Three days at most until we reach the Mississippi and find the next town."

It was in this moment that I handed him Emmett's leather notebook. "We need this," I explained. "It has detailed notes, plans, schedules—everything. But we also need it to stay concealed."

Norman took it, his brows furrowing as he flipped through the pages. "If Emmett's in here, we'll have leverage too. Anything goes wrong; we might find something to use."

Walking through the dense foliage, the air seemed to hum with expectation. The notes had altered the power dynamic, and every step felt weighted, as if the earth itself bore witness to our resolve.

* * *

**THE DAYS PASSED WEARILY**. True to Norman's calculation, after three grueling days and nights of walking along the creek, we reached the banks of the Mississippi River. Across from the vast waters lay Bluebird Hole, a small town cast under the warm afternoon sun. Wooden shacks stood silently by the water, and a few townsfolk bustled about the banks. The scent of muddy riverbanks and wet wood met our noses as we steadied on solid ground.

"We need to scout out the town," Norman said quietly, his eyes scanning the modest settlement. "We'll find someone that looks like they might be interested. I'll pose as your owner.”

I nodded silently, the magnitude of what we were about to do sinking in. We made our way to the general store, a hub of local activity where people seemed to congregate. Norman approached one of the locals—a rangy old white woman with sharp eyes and a hard-worn face. From her demeanor, she seemed typical of those who've endured much and trust little.

"Afternoon, ma'am," Norman greeted politely, his voice laced with a respectful drawl. "I'm looking to sell this boy here. Strong, reliable, and honest. You know anyone who might need some extra help round their place?"

The old woman eyed Norman skeptically, then turned her attention to me. Her eyes narrowed. "He good with hard labor?" she asked, her voice rough.

"Yes, ma'am," Norman replied swiftly. "Farm work, house chores—whatever anyone needs. Name's Jim."

The old woman clicked her tongue thoughtfully. "Well, Mr. Barrow might be interested," she said slowly. "He's looking for more hands to help on his farm, especially with harvest season coming up."

We thanked her and made our way to Mr. Barrow's farm without drawing further attention to ourselves. The man was an overseer type, his handshake firm, his smile thin and practiced.

"Fine-looking boy you got here," Mr. Barrow commented, his eyes appraising me critically. "Name?"

"Jim," Norman replied before I could.

Mr. Barrow scratched his chin thoughtfully. "Well, Mr...?"

"Turner," Norman offered quickly. "James Turner."

"Mr. Turner, alright. What's your price?"

Norman hesitated, listing numbers quickly in his head. "Twenty dollars."

Barrow's eyes were cold. "Fifteen."

There was a brief negotiation, but Mr. Barrow eventually bought me for fifteen dollars, handing Norman the payment. No questions asked; business as usual. The transfer completed, we endured polite farewells as they left.

In the days that followed, I worked under Barrow’s supervision but kept a keen eye on any chance for escape. Norman and I exchanged furtive glances and communicated briefly when we could, formulating our plans for quick and efficient departure.

It was a risky dance, but each moment was a step toward our goal—a life unmarked by servitude. The trust between us grew, solidified by the shared peril and the unyielding hope for freedom.

One evening, out of Barrow’s sight, I whispered to Norman. "Tonight. We leave tonight."

Norman nodded. "I've found a spot by the river. We'll meet there."

The hours crawled by with agonizing slowness, the weight of nervous anticipation pressing on me. But night finally fell, and I slipped away, feeling the thrill of freedom rush through my veins. The stars blinked overhead, silent witnesses to our desperate escape.

By the river, Norman awaited, his silhouette a dark shadow against the gentle glow of the moon. "Let's go," I said, every fiber in me alive with the urgency of the moment.

We pushed the small boat into the water, letting the current carry us. As the town of Bluebird Hole faded behind us, I felt a release—a newfound sense of possibility. But I knew better than to let my guard down. We had miles to go, challenges to surmount.

And so we embarked on the next phase of our journey, the Mississippi guiding us onward, our spirits undaunted by the countless barriers that lay ahead. In the stillness of the night, trust and tension intertwined, binding us together in pursuit of a single, unwavering dream.## Chapter 33

# Chapter 34: Complexities and Masks

R**OADS VANISHED** under the cover of dawn’s gentle gauze as Norman and I made our way into the town of Bluebird Hole. Our weary steps were aligned, each carrying the burden of our shared deception. My feet found solace in the worn, but familiar shoes I had retrieved during our last ordeal. As we reached the town’s edge, the voices of early risers greeted us—townsfolk emerging with the sun, ready to greet another day.

The town was modest, a scattering of wooden buildings clustered around a small square. Bluebird Hole had an unassuming air about it, but we both understood the dangers that hid beneath its calm facade. Norman’s appearance was calculated—disheveled enough to give him the rough look of a traveler, yet clean enough to pass as a respectable white man. I played my role convincingly, my eyes downcast, movements careful and deliberate.

As we wandered into the heart of Bluebird Hole, a man emerged from the general store. His stout frame and heavily bearded face marked him as a constable or some authority figure in town. He observed us with a keen, scrutinizing gaze and then, with an unhurried stride, moved closer.

“Howd’y,” he greeted, his voice rough yet composed. “You folks lookin’ for somethin’ in particular?”

Norman removed his hat, showing a gesture of respect. “Mornin’,” he replied. “Name's Turner. James Turner. This here’s my boy, Jim. We're just lookin' to find him a new home. Thought we’d try our luck here.”

The constable’s eyes flickered between us with a measured scrutiny. He rubbed his thick beard thoughtfully. "Frank McHart," he introduced himself, extending a hand to Norman. "Constable here.”

Norman shook the offered hand firmly. “Pleasure to meet you, Constable McHart. You reckon there might be someone in town looking for an extra pair of hands?”

McHart’s gaze fell on me, his eyes narrowing slightly as if gauging the practicality of owning another human being. “Slaves ain’t as common in these parts,” he remarked. “Folks tend to rely on hired help instead. Less trouble that way.”

Norman nodded, adopting a thoughtful expression. “Understandable. But Jim here is real reliable—knows his way ’round most chores. Mighty quiet, too. Low maintenance, I assure you.”

McHart cast a glance at me, and then a longer, contemplative look. “Still, owning a slave comes with... complications. Legal and social-like. Ain’t wantin’ any trouble with the neighbors.”

I remained silent, keeping my eyes fixed on the ground, aware of the subtle play between suspicion and practicality in McHart’s demeanor. Norman, however, was relentless, his voice persuasive and calm as he continued to extol my virtues.

“I hear ya, Constable,” Norman said with a reassuring nod. “But Jim here is worth the investment. Hardworking and dedicated. Plus, I’m selling him for a fair price.”

McHart gave a grunt, scratching his beard. “A fair price, huh? And what’s that?”

“Thirty dollars,” Norman offered, his eyes remaining steady as McHart weighed the value of his words.

The constable chewed over the number, his expression tight and undecided. “Mebbe so, but I ain’t got the means or the inclination for that kind of arrangement. You might wanna talk to Old Man Henderson at the sawmill. He’s more accustomed to dealin’ with slaves.”

Their conversation lingered between practicalities and cautious musings. McHart’s manner evoked the complexities of a southern town straddling transitional norms—an internal struggle mirrored quietly in the nuanced conversations we held.

“Well, thank you kindly, Constable,” Norman said, tipping his hat respectfully. “We’ll see ’bout speaking to Mr. Henderson.”

McHart gave a curt nod before moving on, his mind likely onto other town matters. The weight of their exchange settled over Norman and me as we watched McHart’s rotund figure recede into the distance. The urgency of our mission heightened with the realization—this delicate dance carried dangers far more insidious than we’d initially considered.

* * *

**WE DRIFTED TOWARD THE WOODS**, away from the prying eyes of the waking town. The cover of trees offered refuge and the cool shade a moment's respite. We sat side by side on a fallen log, allowing the weight of our encounter with McHart to sink in fully.

Norman’s face was set in hard contemplation. “Constable McHart won’t talk,” he assured me, though the uncertainty in his voice was difficult to ignore. “But it wasn’t as smooth as I hoped. Henderson might be another matter altogether.”

I took a deep breath, scanning the dense foliage around us. “Plans like this... they carry too much risk, Norman. Every encounter could mean exposure. What if we’re found out?”

Norman turned to me, his expression earnest. “We don’t have much choice, Jim. Selling you over and over—it’s dangerous, but it’s the only quick way for us to make enough money for our families. We gotta keep at it.”

“But it’s more than just the money,” I replied, my voice rising with the urgency of my concern. “Every sale could mean a lash or worse if they see through our ruse. And what if—what if someone like McHart decides to take matters into his own hands?”

Norman closed his eyes briefly, absorbing the gravity of my words. “I know. Every town, every sale... it’s a risk. But we gotta stay sharp, adapt to each situation. We got each other's backs.”

Silence settled between us—laden with the heavy realities of our undertaking. The forest, resonant with the song of distant birds, seemed like a sanctuary and a prison all at once.

“I trust you, Norman,” I finally said, breaking the quiet. “But we can’t let our guard down. We need to think fast and stay ahead.”

Norman offered me a small, resolute smile. “We will, Jim. We’ll make it through this. One step at a time.”

We gathered our resolve and moved further into the forest, scouting our next move. Our shared struggle was a tightrope walk across an abyss, but trust kept us balanced as we moved forward.

The shadows of the past threatened with each step, but the promise of freedom glimmered like the first rays of dawn, guiding us with an unyielding light. And as we continued our intricate dance of shadow and truth, the Mississippi’s silent currents promised a path—perhaps uncharted, yet unmistakable in its call for liberty.

Together, we faced the unfolding complexities of our plan with a bond forged in the crucible of shared peril and trust, our every step driven by the hope of a dawn where freedom was more than a mere illusion, but a tangible reality firmly within our grasp.

The woods enveloped us, a testament to the truth we sought and the shadows we navigated, each movement a note in the symphony of our enduring quest. Our journey was far from over, but with every stride, every calculated breath, we edged closer to the horizon of hope—a melody formed in the rhythm of resilience, the echoes of an unrelenting dream.

And so we walked on, determined and undeterred, in pursuit of a future yet to be realized but palpably within reach. The Mississippi whispered its ancient promise, and we listened—every step attuned to the cadence of liberation, one note, one stride at a time.## Chapter 34

# Chapter 35: Selling Shadows

T**HE STREETS OF** Bluebird Hole were already busy by midday, dust kicked up by the constant comings and goings of townsfolk and their wagons. The clamor of voices mixed with the scent of wood smoke and freshly baked bread from the general store’s small bakery. Norman and I approached the store discreetly, aiming to blend in with the routine bustle. The quiet desperation of our mission hung between us like a secret not meant to be shared.

Inside the general store, the dusty light filtered through the high windows, casting an ethereal glow on the rows of canned goods and tools. The wooden floor creaked underfoot. Behind the counter stood a giant of a woman, her frame occupying the space like an immovable force. Her sternly set mouth and sharp eyes tracked our entrance, sizing us up with the practiced suspicion of one who’d seen far too many transients pass through.

Norman sauntered casually towards the counter, doffing his hat with practiced ease. "Afternoon, ma’am," he greeted, his voice smooth and affable. "Just here for a bit of a potato."

Her eyes narrowed slightly. "Pick one and pay up there," she said, jerking her thumb toward an old woman churning butter near the doorway. Her burly arm flexed as she pointed, hinting at the strength hidden beneath folds of flesh.

Norman selected a large potato from the bin and handed it to me, the weight of it grounding us momentarily. We paid quickly and slipped out, walking with purpose back towards the edge of the woods where the air felt less charged with suspicion.

Setting the potato near a small fire we built with twigs and dried leaves, Norman took out his knife and began to peel it. "We need nourishment," he said, more to himself than to me. "Long day ahead."

Around us, the forest sighed with the breeze. The tall pines and thick oaks obscured the view of the town, creating a bubble of relative calm in which to gather our thoughts. As the potato cooked, the scent mingling with the earthiness of the woods, we spoke in hushed tones, careful to map out our next steps.

Norman’s face was set in hard lines of determination. "We’ll approach Henderson next," he said, his voice low. "From what the constable told us, he's the best bet."

I nodded, the reality of the impending encounter tightening my chest. "How do we make sure we’re convincing?"

"Simple," Norman replied. "I do the talking. You stay quiet unless spoken to directly. We sell him a story. Just remember your name—February. It's easier for me to remember names of months."

The potato split apart, its steam rising like a fleeting promise. As we shared the humble meal, the conversation shifted between hopeful strategy and grim acceptance of the inherent risks.

* * *

**THE SAWMILL LOOMED** ahead like a great beast, its incessant roar of machinery a testimony to the unforgiving labor within. The scent of freshly cut wood filled the air, mingling with the sweat and toil of the men who worked the saws. As we approached, an uneasy silence fell between us, each step weighed by the tension of our plan.

A thin, surly man stepped out of one of the mill buildings. His clothes were worn but sturdy, and his eyes assessed us with swift efficiency. This was Henderson.

“What’s your business here?” Henderson demanded, his voice cutting through the noise of the sawmill.

Norman stepped forward, adopting the role of firm yet respectful master. "Mr. Henderson, sir. My name's James Turner. I have a strong worker here, name’s February. Thought you might have need of an extra hand."

Henderson’s eyes shifted to me, his gaze like a hawk's, sharp and unyielding. "What makes you think I need another pair of hands?"

Norman didn’t miss a beat. "Harvest season’s coming. More manpower means quicker work, more profit. February here’s reliable and tough. He’ll pull his weight and then some."

Henderson motioned for me to step forward, and I complied, keeping my eyes respectfully lowered. He walked around me slowly, scrutinizing every muscle and movement as if I were an animal to be bought at market.

"Lift your head," Henderson commanded. His voice was neither kind nor cruel, merely authoritative. I obeyed. "Tell me, February, how do you feel about being sold?"

The question hung heavy in the air, each word a loaded minefield. I swallowed hard, choosing my response carefully. "It's not my choice, sir. But I’ll do my best for whoever’s master."

Henderson studied me for a moment longer, seemingly satisfied with my answer. "Alright, Mr. Turner. I’ll take him off your hands, but it won’t be cheap. We’ll settle for three hundred and fifty dollars."

Norman kept his face composed, though I could see the calculation in his eyes. "Agreed," he said after a moment, extending his hand.

The transaction felt surreal. Money exchanged in silence, the only sound the clinking of silver in Henderson’s palm. The deal was made, and there was no going back now.

Henderson turned and called out to a small, wiry man standing by the stack of logs. "Luke, come here. Take February to the shed, give him some water, and put him to work on the pit saw with Sammy."

Luke hurried over, his demeanor one of obedience but with a flicker of curiosity in his eyes. "Yessir, Mr. Henderson," he said, catching my gaze briefly.

Before following Luke to my new station, I glanced back at Norman. His face showed a mix of fear and hope. It was a silent promise—we’d meet again, this was not the end.

**THE SAWMILL WAS** a relentless beast. Each day began before dawn, the groan of the saws filling the air as Luke led me to my place beside Sammy, another slave hardened by years of labor. Sammy’s face was etched with lines of toil, his hands calloused, his eyes quiet but knowing.

We worked the pit saw together, our movements synchronized in a rhythm driven by survival. The sheer physicality of the labor was exhausting, but it allowed my mind to drift, to ponder the complexities of our plan and the thin strands of trust binding Norman and me.

Each evening, amid the haze of sawdust and sweat, Sammy and I would share sparse, hurried conversations. His stories were ones of resilience, of navigating the thin lines between defiance and submission.

"Keep your head low, February," Sammy advised one night, his voice weary but strong. "The more you blend in, the safer you are."

"Thanks, Sammy," I replied, the weight of his words sinking in. "We all gotta look out for each other."

As the days passed, I integrated into the sawmill’s workforce, adopting the stoic efficiency of my fellow laborers. The back of my mind, however, was constantly alert, waiting for the signal—a glimpse of Norman, a whispered message, some cue to execute the next phase of our gamble.

* * *

**THE EVENINGS BROUGHT** brief moments of solitude when the saws fell silent, the clamor replaced by the soft murmuring of the river. It was in these twilight hours that I would reflect on our plan, the deceptive dance we performed, and the flickers of hope carried by Norman’s promises.

The Mississippi flowed nearby, a constant reminder of both confinement and freedom. Its currents whispered encouragement, urging me forward with each beckoning wave. Though each day at the sawmill bore its own weight, my spirit remained focused on the horizon, guided by the unyielding dream of liberty.

In the darkness, the stars blinked like distant beacons of hope. By the light of these constellations, I envisioned the path ahead, where the complexities of our masks would fall, and freedom would be more than a mere whisper carried by the wind.

Together, Norman and I embraced the shadows, weaving our strategy with every calculated step, our bond deepened by the shared peril and the unspoken vows of trust. The road ahead was perilous, but each stride, each breath was our testament to resilience.

The Mississippi sang its song of freedom, and I listened, finding strength in its ancient promise, every note a step toward the dawn, where shadows would dissolve, revealing the uncharted territories of freedom awaiting our embrace.## Chapter 35

# Chapter 36: Escape's Shadow

T**HE SPLITTING PAIN** of my back was unbearable, a constant gnawing reminder of Henderson's brutality. The shack's weak walls illuminated by the dim candlelight seemed like an indifferent observer to my suffering. My thoughts were consumed with the memory of each lash that fell, each one a twisted proclamation of power and ownership. The pain radiated through every part of my body, making each breath a laborious task. Nevertheless, I had to endure. There was no other choice.

Luke led me to the water barrel. The chill of the evening air bit at my skin, intensifying the pain from my fresh wounds. I dipped a rough cloth into the water, wringing it out before pressing it gingerly to my swollen back.

Luke studied me with a mixture of sympathy and detachment. "New here, huh? Henderson don't like mistakes. Best learn fast if ya wanna stay in one piece."

"I see that now," I said through clenched teeth, biting back the pain. "How long you been here?"

Luke sighed deeply, his shoulders slumping under the weight of his experiences. "Too long," he muttered. "Lost count a years. Got these scars to remind me."

He pulled up the frayed hem of his shirt, revealing a web of brutal scars crisscrossing his dark skin. The sight was a stark testament to the relentless cruelty we both faced. "Henderson's a beast," Luke continued. "There ain't no mercy in him."

"How do you survive?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

"I keep my head down, do what I'm told," Luke replied. "Ain't much left for us, but survival. Sometimes, though, thinking 'bout runnin'."

I nodded, the seed of an idea taking root in my mind. "Ever tried?"

His eyes met mine, filled with a resigned sorrow. "Once. Got caught. The price? This." He pointed to his leg, a grotesque knot of bone and scar tissue. "Warn’t never the same after."

A heavy silence enveloped us, punctuated only by the distant sounds of the bustling sawmill. I absorbed Luke's words, their import heavy like the chains that bound us. My resolve hardened. "I'm planning to get out. Tonight. Won't make it if I stay. How 'bout you consider joining me?"

Luke hesitated, his expression flickering between hope and fear. "Can't run no more," he said finally, his voice choking with regret. "But if you succeed, get outta here, make sure to remember us who couldn't."

His words weighed on me, adding gravity to my decision. "I'll do all I can," I promised. "But I can't run alone."

Luke's eyes softened with a touch of reluctant admiration. He nodded, his grip tightening on the cloth he'd handed me. "Sammy's been working hard. She'll be at the pit saw."

The name stirred something within me, and I hurried towards my assignment, my mind reeling from the implications of the night's plans.

* * *

**ENDURING THE LABOR at the pit saw proved grueling beyond the physical exertion. Henderson’s critical oversight coupled with the hazardous work environment became a lethal cocktail of oppression and pain.**

The sun was barely up when I arrived at the saw with Sammy. To my surprise, Sammy wasn’t the boy I’d assumed but a young girl disguised for survival. Her frame, though small and wiry, revealed hidden reserves of strength and resilience.

Sammy managed to maneuver the saw with practiced ease, her hands swift and sure. She directed me with a silent nod, and I mimicked her movements, eyes narrowed in concentration.

Henderson’s glowering figure cast a long shadow over us as he patrolled the pit. "You, boy!" His words cut through the din of the saws, his gaze piercing. "You're slowing down the work! Get your act together."

I tightened my grip on the saw, my muscles screaming in protest. "Yes, sir," I responded flatly, forcing myself to meet his unwavering stare.

We continued our labor, each motion precise and practiced. Despite the harsh conditions, an unspoken camaraderie formed between Sammy and me. When Henderson left us alone, Sammy whispered, her voice barely audible above the saw’s roar. "You’re doing fine. Keep your head low."

I nodded gratefully, our brief exchange providing a semblance of hope. But the reprieve was short-lived. The seething anger in Henderson's eyes remained sharp, and it wasn't long before he found another reason to vent his frustration.

The beating came swiftly, cruelly. His fists and feet rained down on me with methodical brutality, each strike a declaration of my perceived failure. I bit back my cries, focusing on the cold hatred in his eyes as a means of survival.

Through the haze of pain, Sammy's face swam before me, her expression a mix of horror and helplessness. She couldn't intervene, but the silent promise in her eyes spoke volumes. As Henderson delivered the final blow, I was left crumpled on the ground, a broken reminder of the sawmill's relentless demands.

* * *

**SAMMY CAME TO MY aid when Henderson departed, her small hands gently tending to my wounds. The touch, though painful, carried a tenderness that soothed my broken spirit.**

"Y'ain't nothin' but a monster, Jim," she muttered, her voice thick with emotion. "You shouldn've had to endure that."

"Thank you," I mumbled, the words feeling inadequate against the weight of her kindness. "You’re braver than most."

As she worked, the truth of her identity came trickling out like a hidden stream finding daylight. Sammy—a young girl in disguise, fighting to survive in a world shaped by violence and deceit. Her eyes held a maturity far beyond her years, forged through endless struggle.

As the last of the day's light seeped away, leaving us in a cocoon of soft shadows, I turned to her. "Sammy, we got to get out. Tonight."

Panic flickered in her eyes. "Can't do it, Jim. They'll catch us. We ain't got no chance."

"Sammy," I urged, grasping her hands. "We can’t stay. They’ll work us to death. We need to try."

She hesitated before finally nodding, her fear tempered by a spark of defiance. "What’s the plan?"

"We’ll slip through the shed, past Luke. Once free, we hide in the woods. We'll meet with Norman—my friend."

Hope and desperation mingled with the air, giving us the strength to act. Sammy and I moved silently through the shed, our footsteps a whisper against the earthy floor. Luke, worn out from the day's exertions, was fast asleep, his snores echoing in the cramped space.

Holding my breath, I motioned for Sammy to follow. We slipped past Luke and out into the night, our path shrouded in darkness. The chill of the woods wrapped around us, concealing us from prying eyes.

Our hurried steps brought us to the edge of Bluebird Hole. We entered the forest, its dense canopy providing cover. We crouched low, hearts pounding in our chests as we waited for Norman. The minutes stretched into an uneasy silence, the distant sounds of the town gradually fading into the background.

Sammy's anxious eyes met mine. "What if he don’t come?"

"Stay here," I whispered, gripping her shoulders. "I'll scout around. Be quiet."

She nodded, her small form trembling slightly.

Venturing deeper into the woods, I searched for Norman, my mind a frantic whirlwind of worry and anticipation. But he was nowhere to be found. As the forest whispered around me, a sinking feeling settled in my gut.

Racing back to Sammy’s hiding spot, the urgency of our situation snapped into sharp focus. I needed to make sure she was safe. However, the sound of a distant scream tore through my thoughts, sending a bolt of fear through my veins.

"Sammy?" I whispered harshly, pushing through the undergrowth toward the sound.

As I approached the clearing where Sammy had been hiding, a figure emerged, a shadow against the dim starlight. It was Norman, his face twisted in shock and fear.

"No," I breathed, my heart pounding. "What happened? Where’s Sammy?"

Norman’s eyes were wide, voice trembling. "A man—saw us. I tried—"

Her scream echoed through the forest again, louder this time, piercing the night with a gut-wrenching intensity that spoke of captured hope and looming danger.

Driven by a mix of desperation and fear, I surged forward, the darkness of the forest and the harsh reality of our fight for freedom intertwined, leading us into the uncertain shadows that stretched ever further ahead.## Chapter 36

# Chapter 37: Whisper of Ancestors

T**HE NIGHT** was a tremulous expanse of whispers and shadows. Every rustle of leaves bore hidden paths, and every shadow seemed to carry an ancient burden. The distant howls of tracking dogs echoed through the dense foliage, a relentless reminder of our perilous fate.

I surged forward, my breath labored, the pounding of my heart masking the cacophony of the chase. The darkness, dense and consuming, made it nearly impossible to see, but Sammy’s scream cut through the thickness of the night like a serrated blade.

“Sammy!” I called out, voice bursting through the suffocating grip of fear. I pushed harder, my muscles crying out in protest against the relentless pursuit.

Suddenly, I stumbled into a small clearing, where the flickering starlight revealed two struggling figures. Without hesitation, I lunged at the closest one, tackling him to the ground. It was only as I held the writhing figure down, my breath catching in my throat, that I recognized him.

“Norman!” I gasped, the realization hitting me like a brick. We both froze, eyes wide with shock and recognition.

“It’s me!” Norman croaked, spitting leaves out from his mouth. “Jim, it’s me!”

I let him go, my hands trembling. Sammy stood a few feet away, tears streaming down her cheeks, her small hands clenched into fists of terror.

“Norman, what the hell happened?” I demanded between breaths, my eyes darting between him and the frightened girl.

Norman rubbed his arms where I had pinned him. “I found her hiding, a man saw us from the town,” he explained, the rapid breath shaking his voice. “I scared him off, but we need to go.”

Sammy’s sobs quieted as the immediate fear began to dissipate. Her wide eyes stared at us, seeking direction. Despite the chaos, there was no time to lose.

“We can’t go back. They’ll have the dogs on us soon,” I said, urgency thick in my voice. The barks were distant but drawing closer. “Norman, you still got the money?”

He nodded, patting his vest pocket. “I got some supplies too. Some food.”

I motioned for Sammy to come closer. “We’re going south, Sammy. You gotta stay close, okay? They won't find us if we keep to the stream and move fast.”

She nodded, wiping her tears with a determined swipe of her sleeve. The strength in her eyes belied her small frame, mirroring the unspoken pact that bound us together.

With the dogs’ baying growing louder, we plunged deeper into the woods, heading south through the dense underbrush. Each step was a calculated risk, the ground dark and treacherous underfoot. The scent of fresh pine mixed with sweat and the ever-present fear that gnawed at our resolve.

“Jim, how’s your back?” Norman asked, his face tense with concern as he pushed aside the thick brush.

“I’ll manage,” I replied tightly, the pain flaring with each movement. “We need to find a place to rest.”

The relentless pursuit drove us on until we came upon a gulley with a trickling stream cutting through the landscape. An outcropping of rocks provided some cover, a temporary refuge in the swallowing darkness.

“This’ll do,” I panted, staggering to a halt. The pain had intensified, radiating through my body like fire.

Norman quickly assessed the surroundings. “Sammy, gather some bee balm roots and plantain leaves. They’re good for wounds,” he instructed. “We need to treat Jim’s injuries.”

Sammy nodded, her face set with determination. She darted off, nimble and quick, to gather the needed plants from the forest floor.

Norman guided me toward the stream, where I collapsed on the mossy ground, my legs trembling with exhaustion. He carefully peeled back my tattered shirt, flinching at the sight of my battered back. “Oh God, Jim,” he muttered. “We gotta treat these now.”

Within minutes, Sammy returned with the plants. We worked quickly, my mind a haze of pain and semi-consciousness. Norman mashed the roots and leaves into a paste, mixing it with clay mud from the stream’s edge.

“I remember how to do it,” I murmured, my voice barely a whisper. “You have to apply the paste to the open wounds. It helps draw out the heat and poison.”

Norman and Sammy worked together, applying the herbal paste gently but firmly. Each touch was a mixture of relief and agony, but I bit down the cries, focusing on their hushed voices as they applied the makeshift remedy.

“We’ll rest here,” Norman said, his tone steady yet urgent. “We’ll move at night when it’s harder for them to track us.”

I nodded weakly, the agony ebbing slightly with the herbal treatment. My vision blurred, exhaustion pulling me under like the relentless tide.

“Stay with us, Jim,” Sammy whispered, her small hand gripping mine tightly. “We still need you.”

Their presence anchored me, pulling me back from the edge of darkness. But the overwhelming weariness soon took over, and I slipped into unconsciousness, the last remnants of pain and fear fading into oblivion.

* * *

**THE FOREST WATCHED** over us with a stoic indifference, the shadows keeping our secrets as the night deepened. I awoke to the dim light of the moon filtering through the trees, my back aching but the sharp edge of the pain dulled by the treatment.

Norman sat nearby, keeping a vigilant watch. His face was strained, eyes flickering with the tension of our harrowing escape. Sammy slept beside me, her small form huddled for warmth.

“How long was I out?” I asked, my voice gravelly.

“A few hours,” Norman replied, his gaze shifting to me. “The dogs passed by, but they didn't find us.”

“Good,” I said, grateful for the cloak of the gulley and the stream masking our scent.

Norman glanced at the eastern sky, where the first glimmers of dawn were breaking. “We need to move, Jim. Before light. They’ll come back.”

I struggled to my feet, wincing with effort but determined. Sammy stirred and woke, her eyes groggy but alert. “We’re leaving?”

“Yes,” Norman said. “We’ll follow the stream south, stay hidden till nightfall again. We can’t risk staying here.”

We gathered our scant belongings and made our way along the creek, the path uneven but shielded from prying eyes. Despite the lingering pain, I pushed forward, the promise of freedom muting my suffering.

As the sun rose higher, casting a golden hue over the forest, we slipped further into the shadows. Each step was a small victory, every breath a defiance against the relentless chase.

In the heart of the woods, between whispers of trees and the ever-present call of the river, we tread a path uncertain but fortified by hope. The road ahead was fraught with dangers, but our resolve remained unbroken. The dream of freedom propelled us onward, one step at a time, through the shadows and into the light.

Together, we forged ahead, the Mississippi’s song a constant reminder of the promise—liberty held just beyond the horizon, waiting to embrace us under the steadfast dawn.## Chapter 37

# Chapter 38: A River Runs Dark

T**HE FIRST LIGHT** of dawn painted the forest in muted shades of gold and green. The chill of the morning air bit through our clothes, but the adrenaline coursing through my veins kept me warm. I stirred, the ache in my back a constant reminder of the brutality we had escaped from. Beside me, Norman and Sammy sat watchful, their eyes scanning the surrounding woods for any sign of danger.

“Jim, you awake?” Sammy asked softly, her voice a fragile thread of hope in the stillness.

“Yeah, I’m up,” I replied, pushing myself to a sitting position with a wince. The pain flared but I gritted my teeth, determined to keep moving. “We need to get to the river.”

Norman nodded, his expression grim. “We don’t have much time. Henderson will be looking for us.”

We gathered what little we had and set off through the forest, the sounds of nature a stark contrast to the tension that gripped us. The Mississippi River lay ahead, a lifeline and a challenge, its vast expanse both a promise of freedom and a barrier to overcome.

The underbrush thinned as we neared the riverbank, the sound of rushing water growing louder. When we finally broke through the treeline, the sight of the mighty Mississippi stretched out before us, its waters glinting in the early morning light.

“We need a raft,” Norman said, scanning the area for anything we could use.

“There’s driftwood,” Sammy pointed out, gesturing to a pile of logs and branches washed up on the shore. “But we’ll need something to tie it together.”

“I’ll find twine,” Norman volunteered, his gaze determined. “You two start gathering the wood.”

As Norman disappeared into the forest, Sammy and I set to work, dragging the largest logs and branches we could find to the water’s edge. The task was grueling, every movement sending jolts of pain through my body, but I pushed through, driven by the urgent need to stay ahead of our pursuers.

After what felt like an eternity, Norman returned, his face flushed with exertion. “Found some,” he said, holding up a coil of rough twine. “Let’s get to work.”

We lashed the logs together, our fingers fumbling with the twine as we worked against time. The makeshift raft was crude but serviceable, a collection of wood and hope held together by sheer will.

Just as we were about to push the raft into the water, the sound of voices and snapping branches reached our ears. Henderson and two men emerged from the brush, their rifles leveled and faces twisted with malice.

“There they are! Don’t let ’em get away!” Henderson shouted, his voice a feral growl.

“Go, go, go!” I urged, shoving the raft into the river with all my strength. Norman and Sammy scrambled onto the logs as the first shots rang out, the bullets zipping through the air around us.

We paddled frantically with broken branches, the current pulling us into the river’s embrace. The water was icy, a shock that stole my breath, but I focused on keeping the raft steady, my hands white-knuckled on the logs.

Henderson’s men continued to fire, their shots splashing into the water dangerously close. As we reached the middle of the river, a sharp cry cut through the chaos. I turned to see Sammy clutching her side, her face contorted in pain.

“No!” I shouted, the horror of the moment sucking the air from my lungs. We had to keep moving, but the sight of her blood mixing with the river’s flow was a cruel blow.

“Jim, tie the logs together!” Norman yelled, his voice hoarse with desperation. I fumbled with the twine, my fingers slick with river water and shaking from fear. Somehow, we managed to secure the logs, creating a more stable platform as we continued to paddle through the relentless current.

The far bank loomed ahead, offering a promise of temporary safety. As we neared the shore, the gunfire began to fade, the shouts of our pursuers growing distant. We stumbled onto the solid ground, dragging the raft and Sammy’s limp form out of the water.

“Sammy, hold on,” I pleaded, my voice thick with emotion. She looked up at me, her breaths shallow and labored, her eyes glazed with pain.

“I’m not... gonna make it, Jim,” she whispered, each word a fragile thread. “Take care of Norman... and yourself. Find freedom.”

Her words shattered something inside me, the enormity of the loss overwhelming. “No, Sammy. We need you. You’re gonna make it.”

She shook her head weakly, a tear slipping down her cheek. “Promise me, Jim.”

“I promise,” I choked out, the ache in my chest rivaling the pain in my back.

Her eyes closed, her breath slowing until it stopped altogether. The silence that followed was deafening, the weight of her death pressing down upon us like a suffocating shroud.

Norman and I worked in silence, digging a shallow grave on the riverbank. We wrapped Sammy in her cloak, laying her to rest with a reverence born of sorrow and respect. The earth closed over her small form, a final gesture of the life that had been cut tragically short.

As we stood over her grave, the Mississippi’s steady flow a haunting backdrop, Norman spoke, his voice low and filled with grief. “Freedoms come with a high price, Jim. Sammy... she paid it.”

I nodded, the words heavy on my heart. “We can’t stop now, Norman. For her, for us. We keep going. We find freedom together.”

He met my eyes, a glimmer of resolve shining through his tears. “Together.”

With a final, silent farewell to Sammy, we turned our gaze south, the path ahead wrought with uncertainty but also the promise of liberation. The river’s whispers echoed in our ears, its currents guiding us onward.

We gathered our belongings and set off once more, every step a testament to the promise we’d made—to never be slaves again, to honor Sammy’s memory, and to seek the freedom that lay just beyond the horizon.

The Mississippi’s song carried us forward, its timeless melody entwining with the rhythm of our footsteps as we walked into the unknown, undeterred and unyielding. In the face of loss and pain, our determination burned brighter than ever, a beacon of hope in the darkest of times.

Together, we would find our way. One step, one breath, one whispered promise at a time.## Chapter 38

# Chapter 39: Riverborn Strategies

T**HE RAIN POURED** relentlessly, masking the agony etched into our very bones. Each drop felt like a tear from the heavens, soaking us to the core and mingling with the salt of our despair. Burying Sammy on the riverbank was a solemn ritual, the earth we turned feeling unbearably heavy despite its dampness. Her small figure, wrapped in a cloak but bursting with the strength of resilience and the warmth of hope, lay to rest beneath the sheltering arms of a willow tree. 

The physical pain in my back from Henderson's beatings was eclipsed by the emotional weight of the moment. Sammy's sacrifice loomed large, casting shadows long into the depths of our souls. Norman and I shared a lingering, wordless fare-thee-well. The rawness of the night softened as the rain slowly gave way to the muted hum of dawn.

We huddled beneath the dripping canopy, finding what little comfort we could in each other’s proximity. Fatigue weighed heavy, pulling my eyelids shut, despite the gnawing cold. When morning crept softly onto the riverbank, I awoke shivering, my muscles protesting against every movement. Emptiness tugged at my chest until I realized something unfamiliar resting upon it. Emmett's leather notebook. Norman must have fetched it for me during the chaotic flight that ensued last night.

Not quite a stroke of luck, I mused, but nonetheless a thread in the fabric of our fragile plans. I gently shook Norman awake, the notebook in my hand a somber talisman. “We best get moving,” I said quietly, my voice sounding raw in the early morning stillness.

Norman nodded, taking a moment to clear the haze of sleep from his eyes. “We'll head south,” he agreed, the determination evident in his voice. “There's bound to be a boat or skiff we can take.”

The day was damp and chilly, but the rain had ceased, leaving the air thick and heavy with moisture. We trudged along the riverbank, keeping a low profile as we searched for an opportunity to steal our passage to freedom. The trees on the shore proffered some semblance of cover, their drooping branches a veil against prying eyes.

It was late afternoon when we spotted a small skiff, tied near a trotline set up by some fisherman. The boat was unattended, bobbing gently against the current. We crouched behind the underbrush, peering through the leaves as we laid out our plan.

“We’ll take it after dark,” Norman whispered, his voice barely audible over the soft lap of the water. “Keep an eye out for anyone coming by.”

We spent the remaining hours fashioning makeshift paddles from branches, using rocks to carve out basic shapes. The work kept us warm, distracting us from the grim reality we faced. As the final rays of sunlight slipped below the horizon, the darkness descended, shrouding us in a cloak of opportunity.

Nightfall brought with it the eerie silence of the river. With hearts pounding, we moved swiftly and quietly towards the skiff, pausing frequently to listen for any sounds of approaching danger. Once assured of our solitude, we untied the boat and slipped into its wooden hull, making as little noise as possible.

The current was surprisingly strong, steering our course southward despite our efforts to reach the eastern shore. We paddled with steady rhythm, the makeshift oars dipping and pulling through the cold, black water. Hours passed, every muscle in my body screaming from exertion yet fueled by an urgent determination.

Distantly, the lights of a riverboat appeared, its form a specter against the night sky. I motioned to Norman, and we steered towards it, the decision borne from the dangerous but hopeful calculation that we could board unnoticed.

“We get in front of it,” I whispered, the trepidation clear in my voice. “Then tie onto it, climb aboard. Watch the paddlewheel.”

Our hearts racing, we maneuvered the skiff towards the approaching riverboat, angling our entry just ahead of it. The roar of the paddlewheel grew louder, a relentless machine that held the power to destroy with a single misstep. As the riverboat bore down upon us, the churning water tossed our small vessel violently, nearly capsizing us.

“Now!” I shouted, my voice lost in the mechanical din.

We secured a rope around one of the riverboat’s grooves, clinging to it for dear life as the skiff was pulled into the relentless wake. Climbing hand over hand, splintering wood digging into our palms, we scrambled aboard the riverboat's lower deck. The roar of the paddlewheel thundered just feet away, the danger of it an ever-present reminder of our recklessness.

The moment we clambered onto the deck, exhausted and soaked, we quickly sought cover. The boat shuddered and groaned with its own movement, the engine noise a turbulent cloak. We ducked into the shadows, finding temporary safety below deck.

From our hiding place, we heard voices above, crew members reacting to the wrecked skiff now bobbing in ruin behind them. “Looks like someone's skiff got smashed!” one voice exclaimed, filled with curiosity. “Anyone alive in there?” another asked.

“Doubt it,” came the doubtful reply, just moments before the clamor moved away. The oblivion served as our strange and fragile shield.

Norman and I continued our cautious maneuvering through the dimly lit lower deck, barely breathing lest the echoes of our presence give us away. We lifted a wooden hatch that led to a small, barely lit maintenance area crowded with steaming pipes and valves, the engine noise drowning out any approaching footsteps.

We sank against the rough metal walls, our muscles finally succumbing to the fatigue. Norman’s eyes were haunted by recent loss and tenacity. “What’s next?” he asked, his breath ragged.

“We stay hidden until nightfall,” I replied, clutching Emmett’s leather notebook close. “We’ll figure out our next move when the time's right.”

Norman nodded wearily, the despair of our situation lightened by the stubborn flicker of hope.

As the hours ticked by, punctuated by the relentless hum of the engine, I let my mind drift to the rivers untold. The water’s eternal journey mirrored our own—fraught with obstacles, carrying echoes of the past, yet pushing ever onward toward the promise of freedom.

In the dimness of our hiding place, shadows lengthened in muted comfort, concealing and protecting us as we forged our path through the dark waters. Together, we huddled in mutual resolve, our breath synchronized with the vessel's weary pulse, the harmony of undaunted spirits bound for freedom’s distant shore. Every note of hope resonated through the labyrinthine paths, guiding our steps through ceaseless night, one leap at a time, ever onward to the dawn.## Chapter 39

# Chapter 40: Engines of Despair

T**HE AIR IN THE ENGINE ROOM** was thick with heat and the gritty tang of coal dust. The constant hum of the riverboat’s machinery reverberated through the confined space, a relentless reminder of the perils lying just a few feet away. I glanced nervously at Norman, his eyes mirroring my unease as we both tried to remain inconspicuous in the shadows.

Suddenly, the clanging of metal against metal echoed through the room, signaling the presence of another. A wiry black man with a haunted look in his eyes appeared from behind the massive engine, his body glistening with sweat. He moved with an almost mechanical precision, shoveling coal into the roaring furnace with a fervor that bordered on obsession.

“Who... who are y’all?” he stammered, his voice tinged with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.

Thinking quickly, I stepped forward, my tone calm but firm. “Name’s Jim,” I said, gesturing to Norman. “This here is Norman, my... master.”

Norman’s eyes widened momentarily, but he quickly recovered, adopting a stern expression that suited his assumed role. “We got separated from our group,” he added, his voice authoritative.

The man, who we came to know as Brock, eyed us warily before nodding. “Name’s Brock,” he murmured, returning to his task. “Y’all best keep quiet. The Cap’n don’t take kindly to strangers down here.”

I watched Brock work, his movements fueled by a seemingly endless reserve of desperation. Amid the suffocating heat, he seemed driven by an unseen force, his eyes distant and feverish as he shoveled coal with alarming intensity.

As we settled into our surroundings, it became apparent that Brock was more than just a simple worker. His mutterings revealed a deep, almost delusional loyalty to someone he referred to as “Massa Corey.”

“Massa Corey always said keep the engine runnin’,” Brock muttered between shovelfuls, his eyes never leaving the burning flames. “Can’t let him down, no sir.”

Norman and I exchanged a concerned glance, realizing the gravity of our situation. The engine’s erratic noises suggested imminent failure, a possibility that Brock seemed either unaware of or intentionally ignoring.

“Nobody seen this Corey lately?” I asked, trying to sound nonchalant.

Brock paused, his eyes narrowing with confusion. “He... he’s around. Always watchin’,” he replied, the uncertainty in his voice betraying his delusions.

Realizing we needed a plan, Norman decided to venture upstairs to gather more information and hopefully find some food. Before he left, he found an ill-fitting coat and hat from among the steamer trunks stored in a corner, disguising himself as best he could.

“Be careful,” I murmured as Norman adjusted the coat, blending in as much as possible.

“I’ll be back quick,” he promised, slipping away into the shadows.

Left with Brock, I took his place shoveling coal, each movement a battle against the oppressive heat and the pounding of my heart. Brock continued his incessant murmuring, his gaze fixed on the flames as if they held some hidden truth.

The minutes ticked by with agonizing slowness. In the oppressive atmosphere of the engine room, every sound seemed amplified, every movement fraught with tension. The engine’s strange noises grew louder, a high-pitched whine that sent shivers down my spine.

When Norman finally returned, he carried with him a loaf of bread and a scrap of cloth. His face was pale, etched with exhaustion and worry. “The boat’s packed with people,” he whispered urgently. “Rumors of war breaking out. Everyone’s tense.”

“War?” I echoed, my mind racing. The implications of a nation on the brink of conflict were staggering, casting a shadow over our already precarious situation.

Norman nodded, his voice grim. “Civil War. They’re saying it’s inevitable now. We need to find a way off this boat before things get worse.” He tore off a piece of bread and handed it to me.

As we huddled in the engine room, munching on the meager bread, the engine’s ominous noises reached a fever pitch. Norman and I locked eyes, both realizing that the mechanical sounds indicated a serious problem.

“We gotta get outta here,” Norman said, the urgency in his voice undeniable. “Brock’s shovelin’ like a madman. He won’t stop, even if the whole thing blows.”

As if to punctuate his words, the engine let out a high-pitched scream, a sound that seemed to pierce the very air around us. The entire boat shook violently, the vibrations rattling the metal walls and echoing through the confined space.

“Brock, stop!” I shouted, desperation lacing my voice. “The engine’s gonna blow!”

But Brock was beyond reason, his eyes wild with determination. “Can’t stop now. Massa Corey said keep it runnin’. Gotta keep it runnin’.”

Panic surged through me as the engine continued to wail, each second bringing us closer to catastrophe. Norman grabbed my arm, his grip tight. “We need to go. Now!”

Together, we stumbled through the disorienting maze of the engine room, the piercing noise and violent shaking making every step a struggle. Brock’s crazed shouts echoed behind us, a haunting reminder of the chaos we left in our wake.

Burdened with fear and the specters of a future at war, we clawed our way towards the deck, fighting against the very thing meant to carry us to our promised freedom: the riverboat.

Emerging into the open air, the stark contrast between the oppressive heat below and the cool night breeze invigorated our senses. We had no time to spare. Somewhere along this seemingly endless river, we had to find sanctuary. As the boat lurched, we made our decision, casting our gaze towards the distant horizon and readying ourselves for the leap of faith that could lead to our salvation or doom.

Every motion propelled us onward, away from the engines of despair, as the boundless river awaited with its twists, concealed secrets, and the promise of freedom. Together, we fled into the darkness—undeterred and unbroken.## Chapter 40

# Chapter 41: Shattered Currents

T**HE ENGINE ROOM** was filled with a cacophony of chaos—the clanging of metal, the relentless hum of the machinery, and the oppressive heat that made every breath a struggle. The scent of burning coal and oil filled the air, clinging to everything and seeping into our very bones.

Norman and I exchanged wary glances, each of us trying to keep up the facade that barely held our trepidation in check. Brock continued his admirable, if misguided, dedication to shoveling coal into the roaring furnace of the engine, his eyes wide with manic zeal. 

Massa Corey," he muttered under his breath, "can't let him down... can't let the engine stop..."

The tension around the boiler’s growing hiss was tangible, like the oppressive humidity before a storm. The cast-iron monster before us groaned and shrieked, its noises growing increasingly frenzied as if it were protesting the relentless feeding of coal.

Then suddenly, the noise shifted. A high-pitched whine sliced through the room, far more potent than any before. Norman grabbed my arm, his eyes wide with alarm.

"We've gotta get out!" I shouted, my voice straining to be heard over the racket.

Brock's delusional loyalty didn't waver. "No! Gotta keep it running!" he cried, redoubling his efforts.

Norman gave me a pained look, his determination evident despite the rising panic. The air grew even hotter, the tension palpable. Before Brock could even process what Norman had said, a deafening BOOM resonated through the space.

I was launched into the air, the force of the explosion slamming me against the metal walls. The last thing I saw before darkness consumed me was Brock's horrified eyes, wide with a sudden clarity and terror.

* * * 

**THE FREEZING WATER** shocked my system back into consciousness. I coughed and spluttered, thrashing against the biting cold that enveloped me. The river's dark embrace felt merciless, its grip unyielding as my muscles screamed in protest.

Debris floated alongside me, remnants of the riverboat now being swallowed by the river. Bodies bobbed like ghastly buoys amidst the waves, some struggling, some still. I blinked, desperately trying to get my bearings. Panic surged through me—where were Norman and Huck?

"Norman!" I called out, my voice hoarse and trembling as I searched the churning water.

A few feet away, I spotted a figure clinging to a small plank. "Jim! Over here!" It was Norman. 

Relief washed over me, mingled with a fresh wave of panic. He was struggling to stay afloat, his face pale and strained. 

"Hold on, I'm coming!" I shouted back, forcing my battered body to propel me through the icy water toward him. 

Just then, another voice pierced through the chaos. "Jim! Help!" It was Huck, his voice frantic and pained. 

I turned, my heart plummeting as I saw him—Huck tread water with a bleeding forehead, his young face contorted in fear and pain. He was mere yards away, but in the opposite direction of Norman. The water seemed to swirl even more fiercely between the two, the river itself presenting me with an impossible choice.

Time seemed to slow, the frigid water numbing my limbs but sharpening my anguish. The two voices, both calling out in despair, echoed in my ears, creating a tormenting chorus.

 "Jim!" Norman's voice, full of desperate yearning.

 "Jim, please!" Huck’s voice, laced with childlike terror. Each call tore at my very soul, their cries a testament to the bonds we held.

I was frozen by more than just the cold. My mind raced, the faces of both Norman and Huck blurring with memories. For a moment, the Mississippi seemed to toy with me, her merciless current bearing witness to a decision no man should have to make.

Who do I save? My only friend in the Minstrels, a man whose life was a reflected mirror of my own struggles against a world that sought to bind us at every turn, or Huck, the boy who had defied every expectation and learned to see me as a friend, not a slave? Each second of indecision betrayed another thread of our bonds, another shred of trust.

I couldn’t choose. The river roared around me, and I was caught between two impossible choices, their voices growing fainter in the rising storm, my heart splitting with every cry.

And so, caught between the crushing weight of obligation and the wrenching pain of imminent loss, I screamed back at the merciless river, my voice mingling with theirs in the terrible maelstrom.

"Hold on! I'm coming!"

But which way would my heart take me? Would it split itself in two, forsaking one bond in favor of another? Could destiny be so cruel to demand such a sacrifice?

The voices of both my companions called out, and I braved the currents of fate, making my choice—
the only one I could bear, propelled by the relentless, dark embrace of the river.## Chapter 41

# Chapter 42: The Truth Revealed

T**HE FIRST LIGHT** of morning spread softly over the wreckage-strewn shore, its gentle embrace starkly contrasted against the scene of chaos left by the riverboat explosion. Smoke hung heavy in the air, mingling with the guttural sounds of survivors from the riverboat disaster—a cacophony of moans, cries, and the dull sounds of bodies dragging themselves to shore.

I strained against the current, my eyes fixed on Huck’s small, almost lifeless body, bobbing amidst the debris. The river’s hold was relentless, and each stroke felt like pushing against an immovable force. My muscles screamed in pain, my back still aching from Henderson’s beatings and the shrapnel from the explosion.

With the last reserves of my strength, I grabbed Huck and pulled him onto the sand. His face was pale, blood trickling from a wound on his forehead. “Stay with me, Huck,” I whispered hoarsely, patting his cheek gently. “Stay with me.”

He moaned softly, consciousness flickering back into his wide, terrified eyes. I pulled him into a dense thicket away from the shoreline, the cover offering protection and a moment to catch our breath. We were hidden from the prying eyes of those on the beach, many of whom were too concerned with their own survival to notice us.

“Huck, lie still,” I said, tearing a piece of my shirt to press against his bleeding forehead. “We just need a moment.”

Huck’s eyes fluttered open, his breath ragged. “Jim... what happened?”

“The boat exploded. We were caught in it. You’re safe now,” I reassured him, though the words felt hollow given the enormity of our predicament.

As we lay hidden, the morning light slowly revealed the full extent of the chaos. Bodies lined the shore, some moving, some still, their faces twisted in pain or frozen in the final moments of terror. Among the survivors dragging themselves up the beach were the King and the Duke, their gaudy costumes torn and singed. Their greed and deceit had guided them to this point, and I wondered if even this catastrophe would truly change them.

Huck followed my gaze, his young face marred by confusion and pain. “What about them?” he asked weakly, pointing to the feckless pair.

“They’re just like the rest of us,” I replied, my voice laced with exhaustion. “Trying to survive. That’s all any of us are doing.”

Norman’s face flashed before my eyes, his wide-eyed panic and the moment of desperate clarity that led to his death in the river. “There’s someone I lost too, Huck. A friend named Norman. He... he likely didn’t make it.”

The gravity of loss pressed us both into a heavy silence, the reality of our situation starkly evident. Glancing at Huck, I felt a wave of urgency to share what I had planned to keep hidden, perhaps forever. The truth of our intertwined lives weighed upon me like a secret too long held.

“Huck, there’s something you need to know,” I began, my voice hesitant and filled with the gravity of what I was about to reveal. “Something about our past. About... who I am.”

Huck frowned, confusion etched into his young features. “What do you mean, Jim?”

I took a deep breath, steadying myself for the shattering truth. “Huck, I’m... I’m your father.”

His eyes widened, his mouth opening and closing in shock, the weight of the revelation hitting him like a physical blow. “But... but how?” he stammered, unable to process the enormity of my words.

“I was your mother’s,” I said softly. “We kept it secret, hid it from everyone. Even from you. I thought... I thought it was for the best.”

“Why didn’t you tell me?” Huck demanded, his voice rising with a mixture of hurt and anger. “Why did you leave? Why did you let me believe what I did?”

Tears pooled in my eyes, my heart heavy with regret. “It wasn’t safe, Huck. The truth could’ve meant more suffering, more danger for both of us. I wanted to protect you, to give you a chance at a better life.”

Huck’s face trembled, struggling with the implications of my confession. “You’re my... father? And all this time...”

“All this time, I’ve been by your side,” I said. “Trying to keep you safe, guiding you the best I could. Even when you didn’t know.”

The truth was a painful balm, exposing wounds while beginning to heal them. Huck was silent for what felt like an eternity, his young mind grappling with the newfound knowledge.

“Is that why you looked out for me?” he asked finally, his voice small and uncertain.

“Yes,” I replied, feeling the burden of so many secrets lift slightly. “That’s why. But more than that, Huck... I care for you. Not just as your father but as your friend. We’ve been through too much together for it to be any other way.”

Huck took a deep breath, his eyes reflecting the complex emotions raging within. “What about freedom? What about what happens next?”

I smiled, despite the gravity of our situation, nodding to reinforce the hope I held onto. “You have a choice, Huck. You can be whoever you want to be. Live freely. I will always be your father, but you must make your own path.”

He looked at me, his eyes clear and determined. “I want to be with you, Jim. I don’t care about being Huckleberry Finn. I just want to stay with you.”

My heart ached with pride and sorrow. “Huck, you must live as freely as you can. Go back to Hannibal, be the boy you were, but be wiser, better. I need to go north, find money to free my family.”

Huck shook his head, defiance flashing through his eyes. “No, I’m coming with you. We’ll find a way together.”

I sighed, the weight of our journey settling between us. “Alright, Huck. For now, we stay together. But remember what I said. Be free, in every way you can.”

Night fell, wrapping us in a cloak of promises and shadows. The loss of Norman and Sammy weighed heavily on my mind, their faces joining the ranks of the dead we left behind. We huddled close, contemplating the paths laid out before us.

Huck tightened his grip on my hand. “We’ll make it, Jim,” he said, his voice strong and unwavering. “We have to.”

I nodded, my resolve matching his. “Yes, Huck. We will.”

And so, as the darkness settled around us, we faced the river’s current and the uncertain future it carried, bound by the truth revealed and the promise of freedom waiting just beyond the horizon. Our journey continued, undeterred and united, carving hope from the stars that lit our way.## Chapter 42

# Chapter 43: Tattered Pages

T**HE SUN CAST** its first tentative rays over the beach, revealing a landscape marred by tragedy. The wreckage of the riverboat lay scattered along the shore—broken timbers, scorched metal, and the bodies of the unlucky. The air was thick with the scent of smoke and salt, mingling with the subdued mutterings of the survivors who had made it to the beach. From our hiding place within the dense trees, Huck and I observed them, our hearts heavy with an amalgamation of relief and sorrow.

I felt a deep, aching need for rest and recuperation, but such luxury was unattainable. Yet the more pressing concern gnawed at me: we desperately needed a white person to travel with for safety. Alone and black, I was a target, a walking bounty. With Huck, there was a fragile shield of legitimacy, yet even that had its cracks.

Huck turned to me, his young face lined with exhaustion and dirt. "What now, Jim? What's our next move?"

I scanned the scattered remnants of the riverboat, my eyes catching sight of a small, familiar object lying near a fallen figure. It was my notebook, half-buried in the sand near a dead woman whose personal belongings were strewn around haphazardly. My heart quickened, knowing the significance bound within those blank pages.

"Stay here," I whispered to Huck, my voice barely audible. I crept from the trees, my movements slow and deliberate, each step fraught with tension. The other survivors were focused on their own sorrows and struggles, but I couldn't be too careful. I needed that notebook, a repository of thoughts and promises, a lifeline to a world where my voice could matter.

I reached the site and nudged the soggy sand away, retrieving the notebook tenderly. As I wiped away the grit, a shadow loomed over me.

"You there!" a voice barked, sharp and accusatory. I looked up to see Daniel Emmett, his eyes wide with anger and suspicion. "What are you doing?”

The people around him turned, their faces twisted with grief and outrage. "He's robbing the dead!" another voice shouted, and soon, an angry chorus followed. Fingers pointed in condemnation, eyes burning with judgment.

Panic surged through me. "No, I ain't robbing! This be mine!" I pleaded, clutching the notebook tightly to my chest.

But the accusation had already taken root. Instinct took over as I bolted, my feet barely touching the ground as I sprinted towards the safety of the trees. Huck's urgent footsteps followed, his presence a comforting counterpoint to the hostility behind us.

We ran deeper into the forest until the echoes of the beach faded, stopping only when our breaths came in ragged gasps. We collapsed by a massive sycamore tree, its thick, gnarled roots offering a temporary sanctuary.

"They think you was stealin'," Huck panted, his face flushed with exertion. "Why'd you go back for that thing?"

I held up the notebook, my hands trembling slightly. "This book... it ain't empty, Huck. It holds a part of me. My thoughts, my learnin’."

Huck's eyes widened, a spark of curiosity mingling with his exhaustion. "You can... you can write? You're literate?"

"Yeah, Huck. Been keeping it secret. Most folks wouldn’t understand. A slave who can write might as well be an uprising waiting to happen."

Huck nodded slowly, a new respect dawning in his eyes. "That's... that’s something, Jim. I ain't never thought 'bout it that way."

We sat in silence for a moment, the weight of revelation hanging between us. Finally, Huck broke the silence, his voice steady. "Look, Jim, we gotta stick together. 'Cause without you, I’d be dead now. You saved my life back there."

I shook my head, my eyes heavy with worry. "We're better apart, Huck. You’ll be safer. I’ll be one less burden."

But Huck was insistent. "No, Jim. We ain't partin’ ways. Look, I can pretend to be your owner. If anyone messes with you, they gotta go through me first."

The idea seemed laughably impractical. "Huck, you’s just a boy. Ain't nobody gonna believe that."

"Well, then we just gotta make 'em believe," Huck replied stubbornly, his youthful defiance a beacon of desperate hope.

Despite our disagreements, the reality was stark: I needed him, and he needed me. The path north was fraught with peril, but together, we had a fighting chance.

With reluctance edging my acceptance, I nodded. “Alright then, Huck. Let’s go. We’ll walk along the river and figure it out as we go.”

We stood, our bodies weary but our spirits bolstered by a renewed sense of unity. As we moved onward, the whispers of the Mississippi followed us—a song of freedom wrapped in the relentless march of its currents. The journey ahead was uncertain, but together, we forged a path, one step at a time, toward the elusive promise of liberty.

The river beckoned, a constant companion on our flight, its secrets and tribulations echoing our own. As Huck and I walked side by side, the sun climbed higher, illuminating our path with the dawn of new possibilities. We had escaped the shadows, but the road ahead demanded vigilance, courage, and the unbreakable bond that bound us together in our quest for freedom.## Chapter 43

# Chapter 44: The Battle Beneath

T**HE MORNING SUN** shimmered off the river, casting a veil of gold over its calm surface. The deceptive tranquility belied the churning currents below, a secret both alluring and dangerous. Huck and I had been fortunate enough to escape the carnage on the riverboat, but hunger gnawed at our bellies like a persistent reminder of our peril. Our provisions had dwindled, leaving us with little choice.

"Jim, we gotta eat," Huck said, his voice laced with urgency.

I nodded, my eyes scanning the river for any sign of life. Trotlines were scarce in this part of the river, and our situation demanded immediate action. "Ain't no other way," I murmured, more to myself than Huck. "We'll have to dog for a catfish."

Huck frowned, his young face etched with concern. "Doggin'? What's that?"

"It's risky," I replied, my mind racing through the steps. "But we've done risk before, ain't we? It's fishin' with just your hands. Gets the big 'uns hiding in the river banks."

Huck's eyes widened. "You mean, reachin' into holes where they might be hidin'?"

"That's it," I affirmed. "Fish don't likin' nobody disturbin' 'em. You reach in, feel 'round, and pull 'em out."

Huck's look of apprehension was palpable, but he nodded. "Okay, Jim. I'll help."

* * *

**THE RIVER WAS COOL** against my skin as I waded in. Huck stood nearby, his eyes fixed on me with anxious anticipation. I plunged my arms into the water, feeling the bottom with tentative strokes. The opaque water concealed the myriad dangers lurking beneath, each motion a brush with the unknown.

As my hand slid deeper into a crevice under the riverbank, I felt a sudden, sharp clamp. Pain shot up my arm, followed by a powerful tug. "Got somethin'!" I yelled, my voice strained with effort.

Huck rushed to my side. "Hold on, Jim! Don't let it take you under!"

But the catfish had other plans. With a strength that belied its aquatic nature, it yanked me off balance, pulling me deeper. The world above vanished in a blur of bubbles and cold. My vision dimmed as water filled my lungs, and I struggled against the beast's relentless thrashing.

Suddenly, everything went still. The cacophony of the river subsided, replaced by an eerie silence. A figure emerged from the murk, ethereal and commanding. John Locke, with his customary stoic demeanor, floated before me.

"Jim, do you understand the nature of your struggle?" Locke's voice echoed through the underwater stillness.

I gaped, trying to form words. "John Locke? Here?" My words seemed to dissolve into the water. "I just...want freedom."

"Slavery is a state of war," Locke intoned, his voice resonating with wisdom. "A war enacted the moment the unjust force of one man overpowers another. Do you understand what that means for you?"

His words pierced through my haze of pain. "It means...I have the right to fight back."

"Exactly," Locke nodded, his features softening. "Your struggle is not just for survival, but for liberation. Embrace your right to exist as a free man, whatever it takes."

A renewed vigor coursed through my veins. With a surge of determination, I clawed my way back towards the light, the catfish's grip tiring in the face of my tenacity.

* * *

**I BURST FROM THE WATER** , gasping for breath, the catfish's head clamped around my arm. Huck ran toward me, his face alight with a mixture of awe and fear. "Jim, that thing's huge!"

With Huck's help, we dragged the catfish toward the shore. The goliath writhed and slapped its tail against the mud, but we held fast. Huck reached for a nearby rock and drove it into the fish's head with a decisive blow. The catfish convulsed once more before lying still, its eyes clouding over.

My arm throbbed as I washed off the slime, the adrenaline giving way to a throbbing ache. The size of the fish was imposing, its weight a testament to the harrowing struggle we had endured. Huck looked at me, his eyes wide with amazement.

"Jim, it's a monster!" he exclaimed, examining the beast.

I nodded, but the satisfaction that should have come with our victory was conspicuously absent. Instead, a hollow emptiness settled in my chest. The cost of our catch overshadowed its merit.

Huck’s excitement contrasted sharply with my introspection. He patted the fish, a broad smile on his face. "We're gonna be eatin' good tonight!"

I forced a smile, watching him. My mind drifted back to our struggle and Locke's haunting words. The fish was more than sustenance; it was a symbol of the battles we fought both within and around us. The lack of joy served as a sobering reminder that freedom was a continuous fight, a series of trials demanding resilience.

"Huck," I began hesitantly, feeling the weight of our recent trials. "We shared knowledge back there for survival, but there's more to it than that. I needed you to have a choice, to understand what you were a part of."

"And now I do," he replied, his voice steady. "What's next, Jim?"

I looked at him, the boy who had become my friend, my son in spirit if not by birth. "We keep movin'. The river's long, but every step—every stroke—brings us closer to freedom."

We cleaned the fish in silence, each of us lost in our thoughts under the expanse of the sky. Our journey was far from over, fraught with uncertainty, but rooted in unyielding hope.

As night fell, the Mississippi's whispers echoed around us, its currents promising secrets and possibilities yet to be uncovered. Together, we pressed onward, bound by shared trials and the unwavering dream of liberty. The path ahead was shadowed, but each step, each breath was a testament to our unbroken resolve.

With the river as our guide, we moved forward, carving hope from the currents, one challenge at a time, until the dawn of true freedom illuminated a new horizon.## Chapter 44

# Chapter 45: Shadows of War

T**HE DAWN CAME** with a soft, golden light that reached through the thick canopy above us. The chill of the night was slowly giving way to a mild warmth, but the memories of the frigid water still clung to my bones. Huck and I had found a secluded spot by the river, and we were crouched low, our senses heightened, making sure no one from the beach had followed us. The previous night’s feast on catfish had left our stomachs content, but the worry of being caught kept our minds restless.

“We got lucky,” Huck said, rolling up another piece of catfish. “Ain’t nobody after us.”

“At least not yet,” I replied, my eyes scanning the tree line. “We can’t be too careful.”

We decided to rest for a while longer before continuing our journey under the cover of darkness. The river, constant and steady, provided a semblance of comfort, its whispers a reminder of the path we were forced to tread. The Mississippi's currents had been both an adversary and a guide, and it was towards this watery serpent that we steered our cautious steps.

Night brought a cloak of darkness so thick it felt like you could reach out and grasp it. Huck and I followed the river, the terrain tricky and uneven. We stumbled over roots and rocks, the moon offering little light to navigate by. Every noise made my heart race, every rustle in the bushes making me think we were being followed. It was a long, sleepless night.

Eventually, the darkness became too much. “We need to rest 'til daylight,” I said, my voice heavy with fatigue.

Huck nodded, his eyes drooping with exhaustion. “Yeah, safer anyway. We don’t want to break our necks tripping over something we can’t see.”

As dawn crept over the horizon, revealing the world in shades of soft orange and gold, we set out westward. The forest was waking up, the sounds of birds and the occasional scampering animal creating a soundtrack to our cautious footsteps. After a few hours of hiking, we stumbled upon a well-worn north-south trail.

“That looks well-traveled,” Huck remarked, his voice low.

We hadn’t been on the trail long when we heard the rhythmic pounding of feet. A group of young white soldiers came into view, marching southward. Seven of them, armed and uniformed, clearly boys enlisted for the fast-approaching Civil War. The sight of them sent a chill down my spine, their faces worn and determined, yet unmistakably young.

“Best keep our heads down,” I whispered to Huck, pulling my hat lower over my eyes. We stepped off the trail, hiding in the brush.

One young soldier, boy-faced yet hard-eyed, approached us cautiously but with a tangible fear.

"You there!" he demanded, his voice cracking slightly. "What are you doing here?"

Huck stepped forward, his face a mask of innocent curiosity. “Just walking, mister. Figuring our way down south.”

The soldier eyed us suspiciously but seemed to sense no threat. Fear mingled with the determination in his gaze. He gave a brief nod before marching on, eager to catch up with his comrades.

Huck turned to me, his eyes still wide with wonder and a bit of excitement. “War must be somethin', huh, Jim? All those soldiers marching off to fight.”

I shook my head, my expression somber. “War ain't something to be excited about, Huck. It's about death and suffering.”

Huck’s fascination with the soldiers was evident, his youthful spirit drawn to the idea of adventure. “I kinda want to follow them,” he admitted, his eyes alight with the notion.

“No, Huck,” I said firmly, placing a hand on his shoulder. “We need to head north, where it’s safer. Where you can be free. Where I can reunite with my family.”

Huck sighed but nodded, seeing the sense in my words. “Guess you’re right, Jim. Just... don't want to miss it, you know?”

We resumed our journey, the trail now behind us, and our pace more urgent. The Mississippi River was always just out of sight, a reliable companion whose path we followed with unwavering determination. As we walked, the conversation turned to the complexities of war and freedom, each step accompanied by thoughts on our uncertain futures.

“Jim, do you ever think about joining the army?” Huck asked, his voice curious.

“No, Huck," I replied. "My fight’s different. I’m fighting for freedom for me and for my family. Joining the army won’t help me with that.”

Huck was thoughtful for a moment. “Guess I never thought of it like that. Always figured war was about fighting for something good.”

I chuckled softly. “Sometimes, fighting doesn’t mean going to war with weapons, Huck. Sometimes it means standing up for what’s right in your own way.”

Huck nodded, a new understanding dawning in his young eyes. “Reckon you’re right, Jim. We got our own battles to fight.”

We trekked through the dense brush, the sun climbing higher. A sense of purpose fortified each step, each effort to navigate the unforgiving terrain.

As noon approached, the heat became oppressive, and we found ourselves increasingly thirsty and fatigued. The river, that eternal guide, sang its song of promise from a distance, urging us to find our way back to its soothing embrace.

“We need to get back to the river,” I said, wiping sweat from my brow. “If we follow its path, we can figure out our location better.”

Huck agreed, and we adjusted our course. The trail to the river was fraught with obstacles—dense underbrush, hidden roots, and steep inclines. Yet, it felt like the right direction—a familiar and reliable tether in our quest.

The Mississippi's waters, once glimpsed between the trees, brought with them a cool breeze. As we approached the riverbank, the great expanse of water stretched before us, reflecting the sky's ever-changing hues.

We sat by the river, taking a moment to rest and contemplate our journey. The river was a powerful symbol—of change, of challenge, and of salvation. Its constant motion mirrored our own restless hearts, ever seeking freedom.

Huck gazed out at the water, a wistful expression on his face. “Jim, I never asked you... what’s the first thing you’ll do when you get your freedom?”

I smiled, my mind filling with images of Sadie and Lizzie. “First thing I’ll do is find my family, Huck. And then, we'll start a new life. Free.”

“And me?” Huck asked, his voice filled with the uncertainty of a boy on the cusp of manhood.

“You, Huck, will have the freedom to choose your own path. You got a good heart, and you’ll do great things. Just remember to always fight for what’s right.”

He nodded, a determined look settling over his features. “I will, Jim. I promise.”

As the sun dipped towards the horizon, we felt a renewed sense of resolve. The Mississippi's whispers urged us onward, guiding us through the shadows of war and the promise of freedom.

Together, we stood, ready to face whatever lay ahead. Huck and I moved with purpose, side by side, our steps in rhythm with the river's eternal flow. The journey was long, the path uncertain, but the bond we shared and the dream of liberty carried us forward.

With each step, each breath, the Mississippi sang its song of hope and freedom, guiding us through the night and into the dawn of a new possibility. Together, we would find our way, carving our destiny from the swirling currents, and reaching the shore where freedom and future awaited.## Chapter 45

# Chapter 46: Return to Ashes

T**HE MOON HUNGTHE MOON HUNG HIGH** overhead, casting pale beams through the dense thicket of trees guarding the edges of the slave quarters. Huck and I moved like shadows, our footsteps barely whispering against the damp earth. Each step carried the weight of desperation and the promise of bitter reunion. The memories of this place swirled around me, the ghostly whispers of a life torn apart.

We reached the fringes of the quarters, the ramshackle shanties appearing like dark silhouettes against the night. The familiar outline of my former shack tugged at my heartstrings, but I steeled myself against the tide of memories threatening to pull me under.

"Stay close," I whispered to Huck, my voice blending with the night sounds. He nodded, his young face set with determination. 

The night enveloped us as we moved toward the shanty, each step a cautious venture into the past. My heart pounded against my ribs; every shadow seemed to pulse with the threat of discovery. 

We reached the shack, the faint glow of a fire visible through a cracked window. Quietly, I motioned for Huck to remain outside as I stepped through the worn doorway. The scents of wood smoke and the lingering memory of familiar voices washed over me.

Inside, Doris stood by the fire, her weather-worn face casting long shadows across the room. The small flames danced in her eyes as she looked up, her mouth forming a tight grimace. “Jim,” she whispered, her voice heavy with a mix of relief and sorrow. 

“Doris,” I greeted hoarsely, my eyes searching the dimly lit room. 

She stepped closer, her gaze holding mine firmly. “Jim, you shouldn’t be here.” 

“I had to come back,” I said, desperation clawing at my throat. “I need to find Sadie and Lizzie.” 

Doris’s face crumpled, tears welling in her eyes. “They’re gone, Jim. Sold.” 

The words hit me like a physical blow, knocking the breath from my lungs. I stumbled, gripping the edge of the doorway for support. 

“No,” I whispered, shaking my head. “No, it can’t be.” 

“They took ‘em last week,” Doris continued, her voice breaking. “Sadie tried to fight. Lizzie was crying so hard.” 

Grief yawned within me, a vast chasm swallowing the dim hope I had carried. I sank to my knees, the weight of my anguish pressing me down. 

Huck rushed in, his eyes wide with alarm. “Jim, what’s wrong?” 

“Sadie and Lizzie,” I choked out. “They’re gone, Huck. Sold." 

His face registered a mix of shock and sympathy as he knelt beside me. “We’ll find 'em, Jim. We will.” 

Doris laid a hand on my shoulder, her touch steadying. “You need to stay hidden, Jim. They’re lookin’ for you. Ever'one knows you’re a runaway. It ain’t safe.” 

Cotton, a tall, broad-shouldered man, emerged from the shadows at the back of the shack. His eyes lingered on me, filled with a cautious kindness. “You can rest here tonight. But you gotta move on come mornin'.” 

I nodded, swallowing the lump in my throat. “Thank you,” I whispered. “Thank you, Cotton. Doris.” 

Huck tugged at my sleeve, his young face alight with determination. “Jim, I’ll find out who bought your family. I’ll ask around, make sure they’re safe.” 

I grabbed his small shoulders, drawing him close. “You be careful, Huck. Don’t get caught. And if anyone asks, you tell them I’m long gone.” 

He nodded sharply, his eyes filling with resolve. "You can count on me, Jim. I'll find out everything I can." 

Cotton handed me a quilt, the fabric worn and heavy with the memories of countless cold nights. "Here," he said gruffly. "Stay warm." 

I sank down by the fire, the quilt wrapping around me like a fragile shield against the engulfing darkness. Doris and Cotton exchanged worried glances above the flickering flames, the unspoken fears hanging heavy in the air. 

Doris patted my shoulder. "We’re keepin’ watch tonight. You sleep, Jim. You need your strength."

Grateful and spent, I closed my eyes, the warmth of the fire easing the ache in my bones. Sleep claimed me swiftly, pulling me into the depths of dreams where the faces of Sadie and Lizzie danced, their laughter a haunting reminder of what had been lost.

The echoes of a broken past carried me through the night, the promise of an uncertain dawn waiting on the horizon. But for now, I rested, cradled by the flickering shadows and the enduring hope that somewhere within the dark chapters of our journey, a sliver of redemption and reunion awaited.## Chapter 46

# Chapter 47: Shadows and Hope

T**HE DREAM SCAPE** unfolded like a magnificent tapestry, each delicate thread woven with the essence of longing and despair. I found myself atop a verdant hill, the lush valley spread out below. Bright patches of wildflowers dotted the landscape, their colors vibrant under the gentle caress of the sun. The air was sweet with the scent of blooming life, yet it felt alien somehow, an ethereal world almost too perfect to believe.

Beside me stood Cunégonde, a girl with an ethereal presence, her dark hair flowing freely in the wind, her eyes holding an ancient wisdom beyond her years. "Look upon this valley, Jim," she said softly, her voice like the whisper of the wind. "It is beautiful, isn't it?"

"Yes, it is," I agreed, captivated by the surreal beauty that lay before us. But underneath my awe, a sense of unease gnawed at me. "Yet it feels... not quite real. Like a dream."

Cunégonde's gaze remained fixed on the valley, her expression thoughtful. "This place, like your hope, is both real and illusion. You see beauty, but it's fragile, built on uncertain ground."

I frowned, the unease growing. "What do you mean, Cunégonde? Hope is what keeps us going, what makes the struggle worth enduring."

Her eyes, deep and piercing, met mine. "Hope is powerful, yes, but what happens when the foundation upon which you've built that hope crumbles? When the realities of the world reveal that hope to be a mere illusion?"

My heart clenched at her words, the weight of their truth pressing down on me. "We keep fighting," I insisted, my voice trembling with the force of my conviction. "We can't afford to give up."

"And yet," Cunégonde continued, her tone gentle but unrelenting, "understand the economic realities of slavery—the machinery that grinds dreams and hope into dust. It's an industry's value, Jim. You, the slaves, are part of this cruel trade. The freedom you yearn for is but a grain of sand against the weight of this monstrous machine."

As she spoke, the vibrant valley began to fade, the colors bleeding into shades of grey. I reached out to her, desperate to hold onto the fleeting beauty, but it slipped through my fingers like smoke. "No," I whispered, tears welling in my eyes. "There must be a way to change it."

Cunégonde's form began to dissolve into the mist, her voice echoing around me, a haunting melody. "Hope, Jim, must be tempered with truth. Only by understanding the bleakness can you find the strength to build something real, something lasting."

The valley vanished, the weight of her words leaving a void in its place. Suddenly, there was a shout—a frantic cry for help that pierced through the fabric of the dream, pulling me back to the harsh reality.

* * *

**I AWOKE WITH A START**, the remnants of the dream lingering like a shadow in my mind. The room was dim, the flickering fire casting long shadows on the walls. In the hearth's faint glow stood Katie, her face tight with fear. "Jim," she whispered urgently, her voice barely audible. "You gotta hide. Hopkins is coming!"

I scrambled to my feet, heart pounding. Katie pointed to a dark corner of the shack, and I slipped into the shadows, wrapping myself in the protective cloak of darkness. Moments later, the door burst open, and the overseer, Hopkins, strode in, his presence oppressive and menacing.

"Thought I'd find you here," Hopkins sneered, his eyes glinting with malicious intent. "Katie, you got somethin' I need."

Katie's eyes darted to where I hid, her fear palpable. "Please, sir," she begged, her voice trembling. "Ain't nothing here for you."

His laughter was cold, devoid of any humanity. "We'll see about that." He grabbed her roughly, and my heart clenched in helpless fury. Katie gasped as his hand tightened around her arm, pulling her closer.

Hidden in the shadows, I watched, my rage simmering just beneath the surface. The urge to intervene, to put a stop to this atrocity, consumed me, yet I knew the consequences would be dire. Katie's eyes met mine briefly, a silent plea for restraint.

Hopkins forced Katie against the wall, his hands roaming with a cruel disregard for her dignity. She struggled, tears streaming down her face, but her resistance only seemed to fuel his brutality. My fists clenched, the shadows around me suffocating, yet my feet remained rooted.

The assault felt like an eternity, every second a knife to my soul. When Hopkins finally relented, he pushed Katie away, a twisted grin on his face. "Remember, you belong to me," he spat, his gaze sweeping the room one last time before he left.

The door slammed shut behind him, the sound reverberating through the shack like a prison door. Katie fell to the floor, her body wracked with silent sobs. I emerged from the shadows, my heart heavy with guilt and rage.

"Katie," I whispered, kneeling beside her. "I'm so sorry."

She looked up, her eyes hollow, haunted by the trauma. "It's not your fault, Jim," she murmured, her voice breaking. "We’re all trapped in this hell."

We shared a moment of silent understanding, our vulnerability laid bare. Even in our darkest moments, we found solace in each other’s presence, a fragile lifeline amidst the suffering.

The door creaked open again, and Cotton stepped inside, his expression one of weary caution. His eyes met mine, and I saw the unspoken understanding in his gaze. He knew what had happened, the scars of such encounters etched into his own soul.

Without a word, I rose to my feet, the weight of the night's events almost too much to bear. "I need to go," I said, my voice strained. "Gonna head to Jackson Island. Wait for Huck there."

Cotton nodded, his face a mask of resigned acceptance. "Take care, Jim. Be safe."

With a final, sorrowful glance at Katie, I slipped out of the shack and into the night. The river called to me, its dark waters a refuge and a gateway to uncertain possibilities. The journey across was perilous, the currents swift and demanding. But as the first light of dawn began to break, I reached Jackson Island, dragging myself onto the sandy shore.

Exhaustion claimed me, and I collapsed in the sand, the rhythmic lapping of the water a soothing lullaby. When I awoke, the sun was high, and my body ached with fatigue. I set about the task of survival, finding a trotline and using it to catch a catfish for food. The familiar routine offered a semblance of normalcy, a brief respite from the storm within.

I made my way to the cave on Jackson Island, its familiar contours offering a fleeting sense of safety. The fire I started crackled warmly, the flames dancing shadows on the walls. As I stared into the fire, the weight of my pencil felt almost heavy in my pocket—a symbol of both despair and hope.

With a deep breath, I pulled out the notebook and pencil, turning to a fresh page. The words flowed from me, each stroke of the pencil a catharsis, a way to make sense of the chaos. I wrote of Cunégonde’s wisdom, Katie’s suffering, and the relentless pursuit of freedom.

As the sun set and the darkness enveloped the island, I felt a renewed sense of purpose. The journey was fraught with peril, the shadows deep and haunting, but hope remained—the fragile, resilient hope that kept us moving forward, one step, one breath, one word at a time.

And so, I waited for Huck, the firelight reflecting in my eyes, each whisper of the river carrying the promise of a dawn filled with possibility, where our dreams of freedom would finally come to fruition.## Chapter 47

# Chapter 48: Shadows of Retribution

T**HE FOUR DAYS** I spent on Jackson Island dragged on, marked by a monotonous routine of fishing, writing, and simmering in an almost unbearable anger and guilt. The cave, my refuge, bore witness to the tormented echoes of my soul. The rhythmic lapping of the river against the shore was both a balm and an irritant—constant, unchanging, unlike the chaos within me. I grappled with the haunting memories of Katie's assault, my mind a battleground where anger clashed violently with guilt.

Each day, I took solace in the routine of casting the trotlines and reeling in catfish. The physical exertion provided a temporary escape from my thoughts, but the fury burned like an unquenchable fire, fueled by my inability to protect Katie. Writing became an outlet, the pages of my notebook filling with raw, anguished words—confessions, reflections, and unspoken promises of retribution.

But it was on the fourth night that the storm that had been brewing within me finally found its outlet. As the evening skies turned shades of violet and indigo, a group of white men pulled their canoes ashore on the opposite side of the island, their rowdy voices a dissonant backdrop to the tranquil night.

I watched from the cover of the trees, observing as they built a fire and began passing around bottles of liquor. The stench of alcohol and the sound of raucous laughter carried across the water, piercing the serene night like shards of glass. Three of them drank heavily before eventually clambering back into their canoes, their voices trailing off as they paddled away.

One man remained by the fire, his figure outlined against the flickering flames. Hopkins. The overseer. The source of so much pain and suffering. He continued to drink alone, his movements sluggish and unsteady. The sight of him brought a fresh wave of rage crashing over me, and I knew then what needed to be done. The river had granted me solitude; now it demanded justice.

Steeling myself, I crept toward him, my steps silent and measured. The pistol at his side glinted in the firelight, an instrument of power, and now, of dread justice. I reached him without a whisper of sound, my hand steady as I took the weapon from its holster. Hopkins barely stirred, his bleary eyes struggling to focus.

“Wha—who the hell are you?” he slurred, the words dripping with disdain.

I leveled the pistol at his heart, my voice cold and unyielding. “It’s me, Jim. Remember me?”

Recognition flickered in his eyes, quickly replaced by a sneer. “You’re that runaway… the one causing all this trouble.”

“No,” I corrected, my grip tightening. “I’m the man who’s gonna make you pay.”

The threat in my voice cut through the fog of his drunken stupor, fear flashing across his face. He tried to rise, but I pushed him back down, the pistol unwavering. “We got us a reckoning, Hopkins. One you won’t escape.”

Hopkins scoffed, his hostility a pitiful shield. “You ain't got the guts to pull that trigger.”

My reply was a low growl, my resolve solidified by the weight of his crimes. “You don’t get it, do you? This ain't just about me.” I drew closer, my voice dropping to a menacing whisper. “It’s about Katie. All the others you hurt. You stand there as a man, but you’re nothing but a beast.”

His defiance faltered, his eyes darting nervously. “You’d hang for this, boy. You’d be run down and strung up!”

“Naw,” I responded, my fingers tightening around the pistol’s grip. “The river will take care of you, Hopkins. And no one will know.” 

I placed the weapon on the ground and leapt upon him, my hands encircling his throat. The fire crackled, oblivious to the life-and-death struggle before it. Hopkins' eyes bulged with terror as he clawed at my hands, but there was no escape from the inexorable grip of justice.

“Think about Katie,” I hissed, my voice thick with venom. “Think about all the women you hurt.”

Each word was punctuated by the tightening of my hands, Hopkins’ struggles growing weaker. The life drained from his eyes, his resistance a futile flailing against the tide of his fate. Memories of Katie’s cries fueled my strength, each second a reparation for the pain he had inflicted.

When Hopkins finally went limp, a grim, hollow satisfaction settled over me. I had become judge, jury, and executioner—a role I never wanted but had been forced upon me by unspeakable cruelty. The justice was raw, unrefined, but it was justice nonetheless.

I dragged his lifeless body to a canoe, the exertion an almost ritualistic cleansing of the anger that had festered within. The weight of his corpse was a stark reminder of the darkness within humanity. I smashed a hole in the hull with the butt of the pistol, ensuring his journey would be final and untraceable.

With the canoe set adrift, I watched the river—our constant companion—consume it. The canoe bobbed for a moment, then slowly began to sink, Hopkins’ body descending into the depths. The Mississippi’s waters closed over him, a fitting end for a life spent in tyranny.

A mix of emotions churned within me—relief, sorrow, anger, and a heavy contemplation on the force of retribution. The pistol, still warm from the struggle, felt like a talisman of my darkest act. I hefted its weight, considering its power and the violence it both represented and inflicted.

Without hesitation, I returned to the river. The pistol, now a symbol of judgment dispensed, found its way into the water, sinking to the depths to join Hopkins. The ripples it created quickly vanished, leaving nothing but the clear, unbroken surface.

As the first light of dawn pulled the shadows back, I felt an ever so slight lightening of my heart. The journey was far from over, the wounds still fresh and raw. But for now, in the solitude of Jackson Island, justice had been served.

Reflecting by the whispering Mississippi, I vowed to move forward with each step measured, every decision considered. The river's song carried with it the lesson of shadows and redemption, urging me onward—a testament to the ever-persistent pursuit of a freedom not just for myself but for those yet to come.

Huck would be arriving soon—as expected, as hoped. Together, we would continue carving our destinies from the currents, each note, each stride a step closer to the dawn of liberty.## Chapter 48

# Chapter 49: Shadows of Resilience

L**YING ON A BED OF LEAVES** on Jackson Island, I stared up at the fading night sky, my thoughts awash with the turmoil of recent events. The guilt of Hopkins’ death lingered heavily, a dark cloud obscuring any sense of relief or victory. His lifeless eyes haunted my dreams, a stark reminder of the price of retribution. The moral weight of my actions pressed down on me, threatening to crush my spirit. The river’s soft whispers provided a fragile solace, its currents echoing the complexities of my own existence.

The leaves rustled beside me, the sound barely discernible over the murmur of the water. My heart skipped a beat; any noise on this island could signal danger. I turned my head sharply, muscles tensed and ready. But it was a familiar face that greeted me—Huck, his eyes wide with a mixture of relief and urgency.

“Jim,” Huck whispered, his voice taut with strain. “I had to sneak away from church to find you. They’ve been watching everyone closely.”

I sat up, the blanket of leaves slipping from my shoulders. “Huck, you alright? What happened?”

He exhaled deeply, settling onto the leaves beside me. “I’m okay. It’s been tough, though. After the explosion, folks got real suspicious. They think you had something to do with it. They want someone to blame.”

I clenched my jaw, anger flaring momentarily. “I didn’t. But I get why they’d think that. Ain’t safe for us.”

Huck nodded, his expression somber. “A lot happened while you were here. Town’s in an uproar. Rumors flying about the war, folks takin’ sides. People are scared, Jim.”

I leaned back against the tree trunk, exhaustion tugging at the edges of my senses. “Tell me everything, Huck. I need to know what’s going on.”

Huck’s voice was steady but tinged with urgency as he recounted the events of the past few days. “After the riverboat explosion, the townspeople got real suspicious. They found out about the fight with Hopkins, how he’s disappeared now. Everyone blames you, figurin’ you had something to do with it. They want to string you up.”

My heart pounded in my chest. “And you? How’d you stay safe?”

“I played along, Jim,” Huck said, glancing around the island cautiously. “Told ‘em I was looking for you like they wanted. Said I didn’t know where you’d run off to. But I heard some things. Important ones.”

A flicker of hope stirred within me. “What did you hear?”

Huck's eyes softened with the weight of his message. “I overheard that Sadie and Lizzie might be at the Graham farm."

The name hit me like a thunderbolt. The same Graham farm we planned to flee to for safety. My heart leaped within my chest, both in joy and agony. “I can’t believe it,” I whispered, tears pricking my eyes. “They’re... they’re alive.”

“But listen,” Huck continued urgently. “People are saying the war’s making everything more dangerous. Union and Confederacy fighting. Townsfolk saying freedom fighters are to be blamed for any unrest.”

The implication chilled my blood. “Everything’s more dangerous, Jim,” Huck added, his eyes dark with worry. “They want to panic the people so they’ll fight harder. Plus, the rumors of war make people scared. And when people are scared, they look for someone to blame.”

A pit formed in my stomach. I had no time to waste. I needed to find Sadie and Lizzie. But Hopkins’ death hung over me, an act of desperation that I now regretted not doing differently. “Should’ve questioned him more,” I muttered, anger at my own folly simmering beneath my skin. “Should’ve asked about my family.”

“Jim, it wasn’t your fault,” Huck said, his youthful eyes filled with earnest compassion. “You did what you thought you had to.”

The words offered little comfort, but I nodded, absorbing their intent. “I have to find them, Huck. Have to make sure they’re safe.” I took a deep breath, letting the weight of my resolve anchor me. “You need to go back. If they see you with me, they’ll know we've been in contact.”

Huck’s eyes widened in protest. “No, Jim. I can’t leave you now. We need each other.”

I gripped his shoulders firmly, my voice steady. “You being seen with me will only endanger us both. Go back to town, keep your eyes and ears open. If you hear anything, find a way to let me know. Understand?”

Huck’s reluctance was palpable, but he finally nodded, his face a mask of determination. “Alright, Jim. I’ll do it. But be careful.”

We embraced briefly, the bond between us forged in the fires of shared struggle and unwavering loyalty. Huck’s footsteps grew fainter as he made his way back toward the town, leaving me alone with the river and my thoughts.

I stared out at the undulating water, the urgency of finding my family pulling at me like the relentless current. The predawn light began to filter through the trees, casting long shadows over the island. But within those shadows bloomed resilience and hope, driving me forward.

As the first light of dawn kissed the horizon, I prepared to leave for the Graham farm, my steps purpose-filled and steady. Each stride carried the weight of my unyielding determination. Sadie and Lizzie awaited, and nothing would deter me from reuniting with them.

The river’s song resonated within me, a hymn of freedom’s unyielding promise. With justice served and a promise to never lose control again, I began my journey anew. The Mississippi’s current carried me onward, toward a future where shadows would fade and the light of liberty would finally shine. Together or apart, one step at a time, we would carve our path to freedom, until the dawn of a new day illuminated the horizon.

With every stroke and every breath, I vowed to find my family and secure the freedom we deserved. The Mississippi was our guide, a constant reminder of the endless fight for liberty. The quest for justice and hope forged forward, undeterred and resolute, painting each moment with the promise of a brighter tomorrow.## Chapter 49

# Chapter 50: Shadows of Justice

T**HE MOON HUNG** low in the sky, casting a dim glow over the rippling waters of the River. The Mississippi’s dark currents whispered secrets to the night, secrets burdened with the weight of countless lives. With every stroke of my arms, I felt the chill of the water creep through my bones, a cold that was more than physical. It was the chill of anticipation, of a storm about to break.

The rations, booklet, and pistol were secured in a waterproof satchel strapped tightly to my back, creating a slight drag as I powered forward. Memories of the recent past gnawed at my mind—Huck’s determined eyes, the haunting guilt over Hopkins’ death, and the burning need to find Sadie and Lizzie.

The town of Hannibal took shape on the horizon, its buildings silhouetted against the faint, early light. My goal was clear—Judge Thatcher. The man who held answers. As I neared the bank, my breathing steadied, each breath synchronized with the rhythm of my strokes. My fingers touched the muddy bottom, and I waded through the reeds, water streaming from my clothes as I emerged onto the shore.

Sneaking through the narrow streets, I kept to the shadows, my movements silent and deliberate. The town was still asleep, the only sounds the distant hoot of an owl and the rustling leaves in the faint morning breeze. Judge Thatcher’s house loomed before me—a grand, imposing structure that cast long shadows over the cobblestone street.

Scaling the wrought-iron gate, I landed softly on the manicured lawn, creeping toward the side of the house where the kitchen door stood ajar. The housekeeper’s faint humming drifted through the air—a melody that spoke of routine, of a life untouched by the shadows that haunted mine.

I slipped inside, the warmth of the house washing over me, a stark contrast to the frigid river. The interior was a maze of dark corridors and ornamented rooms, each more opulent than the last. The heavy drapery blocked out the first light of dawn, casting the house into an otherworldly twilight.

Judge Thatcher’s study was tucked away on the second floor, its walls lined with shelves crammed with books and legal documents. The room smelled of aged leather and ink, the scents mingling with the faint aroma of pipe tobacco. I rifled through the papers, my hands steady, but my heart a drumbeat of urgency.

Footsteps echoed down the hall, and I froze, the shadows swallowing me. Judge Thatcher entered the study, his eyes narrowing as he spotted the opened drawers and scattered documents.

“Who’s there?” he demanded, his voice a mixture of authority and suspicion. “Show yourself!”

I stepped out of the shadows, the pistol aimed steadily at his chest. “It’s me, Judge. You know who I am.”

His eyes widened, recognition and fear flickering across his face. “Jim,” he said slowly, his voice laced with a dangerous calm. “What do you want?”

“I want to know where my family is,” I replied, my grip on the pistol unwavering. “You’re the one who knows.”

Judge Thatcher’s eyes narrowed, his mind clearly racing. “How do you know I have anything to do with that?”

“Don’t play games with me,” I warned. “Tell me the truth, or I’ll make sure you regret it.”

His gaze flicked to the door, calculating the distance. But he knew there was no escape. “You really think you can get away with this?” he sneered, but there was fear in his eyes.

“I don’t have time for your posturing,” I replied coldly. “Saddle up, Judge. We’re going on a little trip.”

Grabbing a map from his desk, I thrust it toward him. “Mark it,” I commanded. “Mark where my family is.”

Judge Thatcher’s hand shook slightly as he took the pencil, his eyes boring into mine with a mixture of hatred and fear. He marked the map, the location clear and precise—Graham Farm, Edina, Missouri.

With the map and pistol secured, I forced the judge downstairs and out into the cool morning air. The streets were beginning to stir, the first signs of life emerging from the pre-dawn haze.

Under the cover of shadows, we made our way to the river, where a small skiff lay tethered to the dock. Judge Thatcher’s breath came in ragged gasps, his fear palpable as we approached the boat.

“Get in,” I ordered, my voice carrying the weight of finality.

He hesitated, and for a moment, I thought he might resist. But the sight of the pistol was a persuasive argument. He climbed into the skiff with visible reluctance.

We rowed in silence, the only sounds the creak of the oars and the gentle lapping of the water against the wooden hull. The silence was oppressive, a tangible force that pressed down on us with every stroke. Judge Thatcher’s eyes flicked nervously to me, searching for any sign of mercy or weakness.

“I demand you let me go,” he finally said, his voice strained. “You’ve got what you wanted. Just let me return home.”

I met his gaze, my own eyes cold and unyielding. “You think you can just go back to your comfortable life? After everything you’ve done?”

His face contorted with anger. “I did what was necessary. For the law. For order.”

“The law?” I spat, my voice filled with contempt. “Your law is twisted. It serves only you and your kind. What about justice? What about humanity?”

Judge Thatcher’s eyes faltered, the fire in them dimming. He was a man who had never been truly challenged, never had his power questioned. “I was just following the law,” he murmured, his voice hollow.

I pulled the skiff to the bank of a small, secluded island. The trees cast long shadows over the sand, the morning light filtering through the leaves in a dappled pattern. Judge Thatcher’s eyes widened as I tied him to a sturdy tree, his fate now entwined with the silent wood and uncaring river.

“You can untie yourself after I leave,” I said, securing the final knot. “But understand this—I will find my family. And I will never forgive you for the part you played.”

Leaving him tied to the tree, I took a moment to scan his satchel, finding several books that had belonged to Judge Thatcher. Slipping them into my own bag, I stepped back into the skiff, pushing off from the shore as the first rays of the sun kissed the horizon.

As I rowed away, the judge’s hateful cries faded into the distance, swallowed by the relentless murmur of the river. I turned my gaze forward, the map in my mind a beacon guiding me toward the Graham farm and the possibility of reunion.

The journey ahead was fraught with danger, each stroke of the paddle propelling me further into the unknown. But the shadows held no fear for me, not anymore. I had faced the darkness and emerged stronger, more determined.

The Mississippi’s song carried me onward, its currents a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. Together, Sadie, Lizzie, and I would find our way to freedom—one step, one breath, one torrent of hope at a time.## Chapter 50

# Chapter 51: Shadows and Resistances

T**HE SOFT GLOW** of dawn began to filter through the thick canopy as I trudged on, the weight of anticipation heavy on my shoulders. The past three days had been an endless repetition of cautious steps, vigilant eyes, and stomach-churning hunger. Each sound sent a jolt of fear through my body, my thoughts clouded by the constant worry of being discovered. But now, as the first light kissed the leaves around me, a sense of resolve steadied my heart. I was closing in on the Graham farm, inching ever closer to the reunion I had longed for.

The scent of fresh corn guided me toward a sprawling field at the edge of the woods. Exhaustion tugged at my senses, but the distant sight of an old barn invigorated my weary soul. As I neared the field, a figure emerged from behind a row of tall corn stalks—his demeanor cautious, his eyes keen.

“Who goes there?” the man's voice, though guarded, carried a note of curiosity.

“Name’s Jim,” I replied, forcing strength into my voice. “I’m looking for my family. They’re at the Graham farm.”

The man approached, his steps deliberate. He was slim, with a face tempered by hardship, yet his eyes held a glimmer of warmth. “I’m April,” he said, extending a hand. “What’s your story, Jim?”

I briefly recounted my journey, omitting the most dangerous details but sharing enough to convey my desperation. April listened intently, nodding occasionally before gesturing for me to follow. “Got someone you need to meet,” he said, his voice trailing off as he turned towards the barn.

Inside the barn, the scent of hay and dust enveloped me. A woman crouched near a pile of sacks, examining their contents with sharp eyes. She looked up as we entered, her face etched with scars both visible and hidden.

“This here’s Holly,” April introduced, his tone gentler. “Holly, Jim’s lookin’ for his family at the Graham farm.”

Holly stood, her gaze fixed on me, assessing my resolve. “Haven’t seen no one new lately,” she said, her voice soft but firm. “But the farm’s always got folks comin’ and goin’. You might find ‘em.”

April handed me a small bundle of food—cornbread and dried meat—clearly a precious gift amidst scarcity. “You’ll need your strength,” he said. “Eat.”

As I devoured the food hungrily, April and Holly shared what they knew about the Graham farm. “Heard a group of new arrivals were moved to the women’s quarters,” Holly said, her eyes downcast. “Might be your kin.”

The hope rekindled within me, but caution tempered my relief. “How do I get in without being seen?” I asked, my voice steady despite the trepidation gnawing at my insides.

April considered for a moment. “There’s a break in the north fence,” he said. “It’s risky, but most guard shifts change late at night. If you’re careful, you can slip in unnoticed.”

I nodded, absorbing every detail. “What about security?”

Holly’s expression turned somber. “They got men shackled in the main yard. Guards do regular rounds, but they’s not always diligent. If you’re quick, you can scout undetected.”

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the field, I prepared myself for the perilous journey ahead. April and Holly’s encouragement bolstered my resolve. “Be careful, Jim,” Holly whispered, her eyes conveying a depth of understanding. “We’ll be prayin’ for you.”

Night fell quickly, the cover of darkness cloaking me as I moved toward the outskirts of the farm. The break in the north fence proved to be a fortunate gap, offering a discreet entry point. I slipped through, my heart pounding in rhythm with the distant sounds of the night.

Navigating the farm’s perimeter, I kept to the shadows, avoiding the flickering lanterns held by patrolling guards. The yard came into view, the scene laid out in a chilling tableau. Shackled men leaned against posts, their expressions worn but vigilant. The oppressive atmosphere thickened with each step I took.

Quietly, I approached the group, my movements slow and deliberate. As I drew near, one of the men noticed me and his eyes widened in silent alarm. I held up a hand, signaling my peaceful intent. He studied me for a moment before nodding, his weariness blending with a cautious hope.

“What you doin’ here?” the largest of the men asked, his voice a low rumble.

“Name’s Jim,” I replied, keeping my voice low. “I’m here to find my family. They took my wife and daughter. Gotta get them out.”

“Name’s Morris,” the man said, his eyes showing a mix of skepticism and intrigue. “How you plan to do that?”

I pulled the knife from my belt, showing it to the group. “First, I get y’all outta these shackles. Then, we find my family. After that, we run for it.”

A smaller, wiry man next to Morris grinned, a glimmer of hope lighting his gaze. “Name’s Buck,” he said. “Count me in.”

The others introduced themselves—Harvey, tall and stoic; Llewelyn, with eyes that spoke of countless hardships endured. One by one, I worked the knife against the shackles, each click of metal the sound of hope reborn.

“Last one,” I murmured as I freed Llewelyn. The men rubbed their wrists, their relief palpable but tinged with trepidation.

“I got a pistol,” I said, showing them the weapon. “We move now. The women’s quarters ain’t far. Gotta be quick.”

Morris’s eyes narrowed. “You sure about this, Jim? It’s risky.”

“No other choice,” I replied, my voice resolute. “Freedom’s always risky.”

The group exchanged glances, a silent agreement binding us together in this desperate bid for liberation. “Alright,” Morris said finally, his expression firm. “Let’s do it.”

We moved as one, our steps light and cautious, guided by intuition and the code of survival. The women’s quarters lay ahead, shrouded in darkness save for the occasional flicker of weak lantern light. The night air was thick with tension, every sound charged with the possibility of discovery.

“Stay close,” I whispered, my grip on the pistol firm.

We crept closer, the shapes of shacks and the faint murmurs of imprisoned souls growing clearer. Outside the largest shack, a guard stood, his posture a mix of laxity and boredom. We watched, waiting for the opportune moment to strike.

Buck caught my eye and nodded. In a swift motion, he lunged forward, silent and deadly, wrapping a cord around the guard’s neck. The man struggled briefly before collapsing, unconscious but alive. We moved quickly to bind and gag him before he could raise the alarm.

“Inside,” I signaled, leading the way.

The interior of the shack was dimly lit and crowded, the air thick with the scent of human suffering. Women and children looked up, their eyes wide with fear and hope. My heart ached as I scanned the faces, desperate to find the ones I cherished most.

“Sadie?” I called softly, my voice trembling.

A shuffling sound came from a corner, and a small figure emerged, her eyes wide with disbelief. “Jim? Jim, is that you?”

“Sadie!” I rushed forward, pulling her into a tight embrace. “Oh, Sadie.”

Tears streamed down her face as we held each other, the weight of separation melting away in that moment. “Where’s Lizzie?” I asked urgently.

“She’s here,” Sadie replied, glancing over her shoulder as a tiny form moved hesitantly into the light.

“Papa!” Lizzie’s voice was a broken whisper, her arms finding their way around my neck as I lifted her into my embrace. “Papa, they took us.”

“I know, sweetheart. I know,” I murmured, kissing the top of her head. “But we’re together now. And we’re getting out.”

Sadie’s eyes met mine, filled with steely determination. “What’s the plan, Jim?”

“Got some men outside,” I said. “We move quickly and quietly to the river. There’s a skiff on the other side, tethered to the dock. We take it, head downstream.”

The women and children gathered, their fear mingling with a fledgling hope. “We gotta be fast and careful,” I continued. “One mistake, and it’s all over.”

Morris and the others joined us, their presence a bolstering force. “We’re ready,” Morris said, his voice steady. “Lead the way.”

We slipped out of the shack, our movements synchronized by the desperate need for silence. The path to the river lay ahead, bathed in the uncertain light of the waning moon.

Every step was a dance with danger, the shadows of the Graham farm morphing into a perilous labyrinth. But the river called to us, its currents promising a lifeline to freedom.

As we neared the riverbank, the sounds of pursuit grew louder, the distant shouts and barking dogs a stark reminder of the relentless threat. Panic tightened my chest, but I forced calm into my voice. “Keep moving!”

The skiff rocked gently in the water, a fragile vessel of hope. We piled in, the weight of our collective desperation tilting the boat dangerously. Morris and Harvey took up the oars, their strokes powerful yet controlled.

“We’ll make it,” Sadie whispered, her hand gripping mine tightly.

“Yes,” I replied, my voice unwavering. “We will.”

The river’s song grew louder, a symphony of promise and resilience. Together, we rowed away from the shadows of captivity, our hearts united in the pursuit of a dream that seemed both elusive and achingly close.

We were far from safe, but as the first light of dawn broke over the horizon, painting the river in hues of hope, I knew one undeniable truth—we were free at last. The journey ahead was uncertain, but with every stroke, every breath, we carved our path toward a new dawn.

One step, one breath, one boundless river carrying us ever forward to the horizon, where freedom awaited. The Mississippi’s promise sang in our hearts, guiding us through the shadows into the light of a brighter tomorrow. And we moved forward, united and resolute, in the perpetual pursuit of liberty. Each stroke, each whisper of the river, a testament to our unyielding spirit.## Chapter 51

# Chapter 52: The Inferno of Freedom

T**HE DARKNESS** was thick as tar, the world suspended in a moment of tense anticipation. The silence that enveloped the Graham farm was a living thing, pulsing with the unsaid fears and hopes of those imprisoned within its boundaries. From my hiding place near the barn, I surveyed the desolate landscape, the inky blackness pierced only by the faint glow of a distant lantern. Every fiber of my being hummed with urgency, a low thrum that echoed the rhythm of my own heartbeat.

My breath came in controlled, quiet huffs as I tried to steady my nerves. The memory of Sadie’s worn face and Lizzie’s wide, frightened eyes bolstered my resolve—I had to get them out. This wasn’t just about me; it was about a future where chains were a distant memory and freedom was tangible, as real as the earth beneath my feet.

I slipped through the shadows, my movements calculated and silent, until I reached the place where Morris and the others awaited, their faces illuminated only by the faint glow of the moon.

"Everyone ready?" I asked softly, my voice a low murmur.

Morris nodded, his eyes dark and intense. “On your word, Jim.”

I took a deep breath, the weight of my plan crystallizing in my mind. The cornfield—the key to our escape. “We set the field on fire,” I said, locking eyes with each man, ensuring they understood the gravity of the task. “The smoke will cause chaos, give us time to get the women and children out.”

Buck leaned in closer, his expression steeled with determination. “And the overseer?”

“We handle him first,” I replied. “Morris, that’s on you.”

Morris flexed his hands, his grip tightening around the length of the overseer’s discarded whip. “Consider it done.”

The other men nodded, their faces etched with the same resolve that fueled my own heart. We were a unit now, bound by shared desperation and a single, unwavering goal.

Moving stealthily, we crept toward the cornfield, each step a silent promise. The dry stalks stood tall, rustling softly as the night breeze brushed through them. I knelt at the edge of the field, pulling from my satchel the fire starter—a small tin of kerosene and a bundle of rags.

“Morris,” I whispered, handing the whip to him. “Find the overseer.”

Morris slipped away, his large frame blending into the shadows as he moved toward the barn. The rest of us worked quickly, soaking the rags in kerosene and placing them strategically among the cornstalks.

The strike of the flint sounded deafening in the quiet night, but within moments, small tongues of flame began to lick at the dry stalks, growing with each passing second. The fire spread with a voracious hunger, thick smoke curling upward and spiraling into the sky. The air filled with the acrid scent of burning corn, a potent mix that stung the eyes and seared the lungs.

“This’ll do it,” Buck muttered, stepping back to watch the flames grow. “This’ll give us a shot.”

As the fire intensified, so did the chaos. Within moments, shouts and cries echoed through the night, the slaves and masters alike reacting to the sudden blaze. I darted back toward the women’s quarters, my heart pounding in rhythm with the crackling flames.

At the door of the smallest structure, I found Sadie and Lizzie. Sadie’s face was a study in fierce determination, while Lizzie clung to her mother, her eyes wide with fear.

“We gotta move,” I said urgently, grabbing Sadie’s arm. “Now.”

Lizzie’s tiny hand slipped into mine, her grip surprisingly strong. For a moment, the world narrowed to just the three of us, our heartbeats merging into a single, unified rhythm.

“Gather the others,” I called back to the men. “We head north, through the woods.”

With Lizzie secure in one arm and Sadie close by, we moved swiftly, the flames behind us transforming the night into a landscape of chaos and confusion. The smoke was thick, curling around us like a living thing, but it also formed a cloak that hid our movements from prying eyes.

The overseer, now subdued by Morris, lay near the edge of the field, his unconscious form splayed across the ground. There was no time to waste—every second counted. Morris gave a sharp nod, his grip on the whip unwavering as he secured the last of the bonds around the man’s wrists and ankles.

“Everyone’s ready,” Morris whispered, his voice barely audible over the roar of the fire.

“Good,” I replied, turning back to the group. “We go now.”

We moved as a single unit, our steps synchronized by necessity and urgency. The women and children, their faces pinched with fear and determination, followed closely, each step taking us further from the inferno that was rapidly consuming the cornfield and the Graham farm.

But it wasn’t long before our escape was threatened. An old white man, his form lit by the eerie glow of the fire, emerged from the main house. His shotgun glinted menacingly in the flickering light, his eyes narrowing as he spotted our group.

“Where d’you think you’re going?” his voice roared, the shotgun leveling toward us.

Fear tightened its grip on my chest, but it was a cold, controlled fear, honed by desperation. I stepped forward, lifting the pistol in my free hand, its weight a solemn promise.

“Get back,” the old man snarled, his finger tightening on the trigger.

But before he could fire, I squeezed the trigger of the pistol, the shot ringing out like the final note of a dirge. The old man staggered, a look of shock etched into his features as he crumpled to the ground, the shotgun slipping from his grasp.

For a moment, the world was suspended in a silence broken only by the soft crackling of the flames and the labored breaths of the escaping slaves. I lowered the pistol, my hand shaking slightly with the realization of what I had done.

“The angel of death,” I whispered, the words a bitter echo of the reality I had embraced.

Sadie’s hand tightened on mine, her voice urgent. “Jim, we have to go.”

Nodding, I scooped Lizzie into my arms, her small body trembling against my chest. “Papa,” she whispered, her voice fragile but hopeful.

“I’m here,” I murmured, pressing a kiss to her forehead. “I’m here, baby.”

We ran north, splitting into two paths to reduce the risk of capture. Morris led one group down the road, while Buck and I guided the others through the dense woodlands. The urgency of our flight was a palpable force, driving us forward even as fatigue gnawed at our reserves.

The woods closed around us, the shadows forming a protective shroud against the encroaching dawn. The fire’s distant glow faded away, replaced by the natural darkness of the forest. Every step was a beat in the rhythm of our heartbeats, every breath a testament to our unyielding determination.

As we ran, Lizzie’s soft whispers reached my ear, a soothing mantra that kept my focus sharp. “Papa,” she murmured again and again, her voice an anchor against the chaos.

We pressed on, the weight of our escape driving us ever forward. The hope of freedom loomed ahead like the first light of dawn, guiding us through the uncertain terrain.

The Mississippi’s song echoed in our hearts, its currents a lifeline that promised a brighter tomorrow. The journey was fraught with danger, but with every step, every breath, we moved closer to the dawn of liberty.

Together, we carved our path through the shadows, the Mississippi our constant companion, carrying us through the darkness and into the light. One step at a time, we pursued the dream of freedom, undeterred and unyielding, forging our destiny with every stride. The river’s whisper and the promise of a new dawn guided us onward, ever forward toward the horizon where hope and freedom awaited.## Chapter 52## Chapter 52

# Chapter 53: Shadows of Freedom

T**HE MORNING SUN** rose gently over the horizon, casting a soft glow over the town of Keokuk, Iowa. Jim, Sadie, Lizzie, Morris, and Buck moved cautiously, every step laced with the tension of being runaways. The journey north had been fraught with perils, each one leaving its mark on their weary bodies and souls. But here, in this quiet town, they hoped to find a semblance of refuge.

The town was alive with the rhythms of daily life. A blacksmith hammered on his anvil, producing a steady melody that echoed through the streets. Children played near the market square, their laughter a welcome contrast to the grim reality the group had known. Yet, beneath the surface, the suspicion of the local white people was palpable, a reflection of the Civil War's impact on their situation.

“The South's fightin' to keep us in chains,” Morris muttered, his tall frame tense as he kept a watchful eye on their surroundings. “We gotta tread careful here, Jim.”

Jim nodded, gripping Lizzie’s small hand firmly. “We can’t let our guard down, not for a second.”

The group moved as one, every motion synchronized by their shared determination to remain free. Sadie’s eyes scanned the town, her face a mask of calm despite the fear gnawing at her insides. Buck, ever brave and determined, walked at the rear, ensuring no one was left behind.

As they passed the local tavern, heads turned, whispers followed them like shadows. Jim could feel the weight of those curious, watchful eyes, each one a potential threat. The tension coiled tighter around them, a constant reminder of their precarious existence.

Their steps brought them to the edge of the market square, where vendors hawked their wares and townsfolk mingled. The group’s presence was noted, the murmurs growing louder. A heavy silence enveloped them as a figure stepped into their path—a man with an air of authority, his gaze sharp and discerning.

The sheriff.

He was broad-shouldered, with a steely gaze that could pierce through even the thickest of deceptions. His hand rested on the butt of his pistol, casual yet ominous. “Morning folks,” he greeted, his voice carrying the weight of suspicion. “You passing through, or planning to stay?”

Jim took a step forward, drawing himself up to full height, his voice steady. “Name’s James, sir. This here is my wife, Sadie, and our daughter, Lizzie. These are our friends, Morris and Buck.”

The sheriff’s eyes flicked over each member of the group, his expression unreadable. “You come a long way, haven’t you? Folks here get nervous about strangers, especially when they hear stories ‘bout runaway slaves.”

A collective shiver ran through the group. Lizzie clung tighter to Jim, her young eyes wide with fear. Jim squared his shoulders, meeting the sheriff’s gaze head-on. “We’re free now,” he said firmly. “We’re just lookin’ for a place to rest.”

The sheriff’s eyes narrowed, his fingers drumming on the handle of his pistol. “You sure about that? Heard tell of a ‘Nigger Jim’ stirring up trouble south of here. Didn’t suppose I’d run into you.”

Jim’s heart pounded in his chest, but he maintained his composure. “My name is James,” he repeated, his voice clear. “Just James.”

The sheriff leaned in closer, his voice a low growl. “And what’s your full name, Just James?”

Jim held the sheriff’s gaze, the weight of his past and the hope for his family’s future hanging in the balance. “Just James,” he insisted, his tone unwavering. “That’s all there is to it.”

The tension was a living thing, stretching and straining under the scrutiny of the sheriff’s piercing eyes. The townsfolk watched with bated breath, the silence in the square heavy and fraught with unspoken questions.

After what felt like an eternity, the sheriff finally straightened, his gaze flickering over the group once more. “You best keep out of trouble, Just James,” he said, his voice laced with warning. “This town doesn’t take kindly to lawbreakers.”

Jim nodded, relief mingling with the tight coil of anxiety that refused to dissipate. “We’re just here for a short while,” he replied. “We won’t cause any trouble.”

The sheriff gave a curt nod before turning on his heel and walking away, his presence a lingering shadow over their relief.

As the group moved onward, the sheriff’s figure receded into the distance, but his suspicion lingered in the air, a stark reminder of the fragile line they walked.

Sadie’s hand found Jim's, her grip a reassuring anchor. “We made it this far, Jim,” she murmured, her voice a steady whisper. “We’ll find a way.”

Jim glanced down at Lizzie, her small face filled with a mix of confusion and trust. He knelt beside her, his voice soft and earnest. “We stay together, Lizzie. No matter what.”

Lizzie nodded, her young mind grasping the gravity of his words. “Together, Papa.”

Morris and Buck exchanged glances, their faces reflecting the same determination that had kept them moving forward. “We gotta keep pushin’,” Morris said, his tone firm. “Ain’t nothin’ easy about freedom.”

“Not yet,” Buck added, his eyes scanning the people, each one a potential ally or adversary. “But one day.”

The group pressed on, each step a defiant assertion of their will to survive and thrive. The town of Keokuk held no guarantees, only a fleeting sanctuary in their relentless pursuit of liberty. But with each other, they knew they could face whatever came their way.

Together, they would carve out a future in the shadows of their past, forging a path to a freedom that was rightfully theirs. Each stride forward was a testament to their unyielding spirit, each breath a promise renewed.

The river's song guided them, its currents a silent reminder of the journey they had endured and the possibilities that lay ahead. In the depths of their hearts, hope rose like the dawn, an unbreakable beacon leading them ever closer to the horizon where freedom awaited.## Chapter 53
