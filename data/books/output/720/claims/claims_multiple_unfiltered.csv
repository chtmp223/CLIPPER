   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation, but it lacks explicit confirmation regarding the location.

""Captain Lingard arranged the marriage between Almayer and his biological Malay daughter"": The chapter outline in Chapter 2, event 3, states that Lingard arranged the marriage between Almayer and a Malay girl. However, the outline does not specify that this Malay girl is Lingard's biological daughter. The summary mentions that Almayer's wife is a Malay woman and Lingard's adopted daughter, but it does not confirm her as Lingard's biological daughter.
   b. ""in Macassar"": The chapter outline does not mention Macassar as the location where the marriage was arranged. The summary also does not provide this detail.

   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it introduces details not grounded in the text.

Since 1a. and 2a. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
