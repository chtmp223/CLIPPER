In a gripping tale of intrigue and suspense, Arsène Lupin finds himself entangled in a complex web of deceit, betrayal, and high-stakes drama involving a mysterious crystal stopper and a list known as the "Twenty-seven." The story unfolds with Lupin's two accomplices, Gilbert and Vaucheray, embroiled in a murder case after a failed burglary at the Villa Marie-Thérèse. As the trial progresses, it becomes evident that the law is determined to make an example of them due to their association with Lupin.

Lupin's investigation into the mysterious crystal stopper leads him to Alexis Daubrecq, a cunning and ruthless deputy who holds significant power through blackmail. Daubrecq possesses a list of influential individuals involved in a political scandal, the "Twenty-seven," which he uses to manipulate and extort them. Lupin's quest to retrieve the list becomes urgent as it holds the key to saving Gilbert and Vaucheray from the guillotine.

Throughout the narrative, Lupin encounters numerous obstacles, including betrayal from within his own ranks, as two of his men, the Growler and the Masher, appear to be working against him. Meanwhile, Clarisse Mergy, Gilbert's mother, becomes a pivotal character. Her past intertwines with Daubrecq's, as her late husband, Victorien Mergy, was driven to suicide due to Daubrecq's machinations. Clarisse's desperation to save her son leads her to collaborate with Lupin, despite her initial mistrust.

The narrative reveals Daubrecq's life as one of manipulation and extortion, using the list to ruin and control others. Lupin's investigation is fraught with danger, as Daubrecq's enemies, including the Marquis d'Albufex, also vie for the list. Daubrecq is eventually kidnapped by d'Albufex, who seeks to extract the list's location through torture. Lupin, witnessing this, plans to use the chaos to his advantage.

Despite setbacks, including a severe injury during an attempt to rescue Daubrecq, Lupin's determination remains unshaken. He eventually discovers that the crystal stopper's significance lies in its connection to the list, but Daubrecq's cunning and the involvement of various factions complicate the retrieval.

As the execution date for Gilbert and Vaucheray looms, Lupin races against time to outmaneuver Daubrecq and his adversaries. The story weaves through a series of daring escapades, with Lupin leveraging his wit and resourcefulness to uncover the truth and secure the list, ultimately aiming to save his friends from their grim fate.
