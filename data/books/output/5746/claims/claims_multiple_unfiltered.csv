    b. Shabaka later proposes a plan to use the seal against Idernes: This part is grounded in event 5 of Chapter 9, where Shabaka reveals he possesses the Great King's seal and proposes a plan to use it against Idernes.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The theft of the seal by Bes directly enables Shabaka to have the seal in his possession, which he then uses to propose a plan against Idernes.
    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly grounded in the chapter outline.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as there is no contradicting information.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Bes's theft of the King's crown at the river"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The outline mentions Bes cutting Houman's bonds and stealing the King's seal, but there is no mention of a crown being stolen.
   b. ""enables Shabaka to later propose a plan to use the crown against Idernes"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The outline mentions Shabaka proposing a plan to use the King's seal against Idernes, but not a crown.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not meaningful because the claim incorrectly identifies the stolen item as a crown instead of a seal. The plan involves the seal, not a crown.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the claim misidentifies the stolen item.

Since the claim misidentifies the stolen item and the relationship is not meaningful or grounded in the provided information, the claim is INVALID."
