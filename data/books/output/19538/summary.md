In a thrilling tale of adventure and courage, four young boys—Donald Mackay, Adrian Sherwood, William Stonewall Jackson Winkle (known as Broncho Billie), and Pedro Sanchez—find themselves in the midst of the Mexican Revolution. The story begins with the boys observing a group of horsemen from the summit of Real del Monte. Suspecting them to be Zapatistas, followers of the bandit leader Emilio Zapata, they decide to intervene in what they believe to be an impending train robbery. Their plan involves separating the engine and express car from the rest of the train to surprise the bandits. Despite the engine being derailed, Adrian and Billie manage to prevent the robbery, although Billie is left behind and must find his way back to his friends.

The boys, known as the Broncho Rider Boys for their previous daring adventures, are staying with Pedro's family in Mexico City. They have come to Mexico to visit Pedro, the son of General Sanchez, a friend of the late President Madero. The country is in turmoil due to the ongoing revolution, and tensions are high between the factions of Huerta and Carranza.

As the situation in Mexico escalates, the boys find themselves caught in a web of political intrigue. They learn about a mysterious brass-bound box left in a bank by a man named James Moon, which is said to contain the secret to Montezuma's treasure. The box disappears, and they are tasked with finding it. Their search leads them to discover a network of tunnels connecting the homes of Santiago Ojeda, a descendant of Montezuma, and Don Esteban Mendoza, a local banker.

In their quest, the boys encounter Francisco Rodriguez, a mountebank, who has been manipulating Santiago and has knowledge of the treasure. Santiago, in a feverish state, reveals the history of the treasure and his connection to it. The boys learn that Santiago's family has been the guardians of Montezuma's treasure, hidden since the Spanish conquest. Santiago dies, leaving the mystery of the treasure unresolved.

Meanwhile, tensions between the United States and Mexico increase, leading to the occupation of Vera Cruz by American forces. The boys, caught in the political upheaval, must navigate their way back to safety. They are involved in a daring mission to rescue American hostages taken by Mexican forces, showcasing their bravery and quick thinking.

Throughout their journey, the boys demonstrate courage, loyalty, and resourcefulness. They navigate a landscape fraught with danger, from battling bandits to uncovering secrets buried for centuries. Their adventures highlight the complexities of a country in revolution and the challenges faced by those caught in the crossfire.

In the end, the boys return to the United States, leaving behind a country still in turmoil but having formed lasting friendships and learned invaluable lessons about bravery and the human spirit. The story is a testament to the adventurous spirit of youth and the bonds of friendship forged in the face of adversity.
