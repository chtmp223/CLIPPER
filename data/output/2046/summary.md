In the Southern United States, the institution of slavery is deeply entrenched, with laws and societal norms dehumanizing slaves and treating them as mere property. The narrative begins with an auction in Richmond, Virginia, where Currer and her daughters, Clotel and Althesa, are among the slaves being sold. Clotel, a beautiful quadroon, is sold to Horatio Green, a young man who promises to free her, but societal pressures and his eventual marriage to a white woman, Gertrude, lead to Clotel's abandonment.

Clotel's story intertwines with other characters, such as Georgiana Peck, the daughter of a Southern preacher, who becomes an advocate for the abolition of slavery after being influenced by her education in the North. Georgiana uses her influence to improve the conditions for her father's slaves, eventually planning for their emancipation. Her efforts are cut short by her untimely death, but her legacy inspires others, including her husband Carlton, to continue the fight for freedom.

The narrative also follows Althesa, who is sold to a man named James Crawford in New Orleans. Despite the initial degradation of her position as a slave, Althesa's intelligence and charm attract the attention of Dr. Henry Morton, a young physician from Vermont. Morton purchases Althesa and marries her, and they begin a new life together, free from the bonds of slavery.

Meanwhile, Clotel, determined to reunite with her daughter Mary, whom she left behind with Horatio, disguises herself as a man and embarks on a perilous journey back to Virginia. Her efforts are thwarted when she is captured and imprisoned in Washington, D.C., awaiting sale to the deep South. In a desperate bid for freedom, Clotel escapes the prison but ultimately meets a tragic end, drowning in the Potomac River while trying to evade capture.

The story highlights the harsh realities of slavery, including the separation of families, the moral corruption it engenders in both slaveholders and the enslaved, and the resistance and resilience of those who seek freedom. Through the lives of Clotel, Althesa, and other characters, the narrative exposes the hypocrisy of a nation that proclaims liberty while perpetuating the enslavement of millions. Ultimately, it calls for empathy, justice, and the abolition of slavery, urging readers to consider the humanity and rights of all people.
