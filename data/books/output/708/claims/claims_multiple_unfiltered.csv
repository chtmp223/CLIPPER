""observing that their mining patterns have changed from digging deeper to moving horizontally and upwards towards the king's house"": This part is grounded in Chapter 25, where Curdie observes changes in goblin mining patterns, noting they are no longer digging deeper but moving horizontally and upwards (event 1).

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is meaningful and valid. Curdie's use of the string to navigate and map the tunnels logically leads to his observation of the goblins' changed mining patterns.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is a logical sequence of events based on Curdie's actions and observations.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline. Curdie's exploration and mapping efforts are consistent with his role in uncovering the goblins' plans.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
   a. ""Curdie uses a compass to navigate and map the goblins' tunnels"": There is no mention of Curdie using a compass in either the book summary or the chapter outline. Instead, the chapter outlines mention Curdie using a ball of string to navigate the tunnels (Chapter 12, event 4).
   b. ""observing that their mining patterns have changed from moving horizontally to digging deeper away from the king's house"": This part is partially grounded in Chapter 25, event 1, where Curdie observes changes in the goblins' mining patterns. However, the outline states that the goblins are moving horizontally and upwards, not digging deeper.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not meaningful because the claim incorrectly states the use of a compass and misrepresents the direction of the goblins' mining activities.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it introduces incorrect details about Curdie's navigation method and the goblins' mining patterns.

Since 1a., 1b., 2a., and 2b. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."

   a. ""Curdie struggles to navigate the dark passages of the goblin kingdom"": This part is grounded in Chapter 9, where Curdie struggles to find his way back through the dark passages after escaping the goblin palace.
   b. ""often returning home with his guiding string tangled"": This part is grounded in Chapter 12, where Curdie returns home with his string often tangled after exploring the goblins' territory.
   c. ""which his mother then winds back into a neat ball for his next expedition"": This part is also grounded in Chapter 12, where it is mentioned that his mother winds the tangled string back into a neat ball.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. Curdie's struggle to navigate the dark passages is directly related to his use of the guiding string, which becomes tangled, and his mother's action of winding it back is a logical consequence of this situation.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly supported by the chapter outline.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it describes a consistent sequence of events related to Curdie's explorations and his interactions with his mother.

    a. ""Curdie easily navigates the well-lit passages of the goblin kingdom"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The outline mentions Curdie struggling to find his way back through dark passages (Chapter 9, event 6), which contradicts the claim of easy navigation and well-lit passages.
    b. ""always returning home with his guiding string neatly wound"": This part is partially grounded in Chapter 12, event 7, where Curdie returns home with his string often tangled, and his mother winds it back into a neat ball. However, the claim implies that the string is always neatly wound upon his return, which is not supported by the outline.
    c. ""which his father then checks for damage before his next expedition"": This part is not mentioned in the chapter outline. There is no indication that Curdie's father checks the string for damage.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the claim presents a scenario that is not supported by the chapter outline. The outline suggests difficulties in navigation and tangled string, contradicting the claim's portrayal of ease and neatness.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and assumption not explicitly stated in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it contradicts the outlined events.
