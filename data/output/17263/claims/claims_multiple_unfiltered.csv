   b. ""having a public conversation with Mr. Moggridge about their friendship"": This part is grounded in Chapter 13, where Mrs. Goodwyn-Sandys and Mr. Moggridge have a private conversation about their relationship.
   c. ""showing interest in a ship's dining room and wind speeds"": This part is not explicitly mentioned in the chapter outlines. Mrs. Goodwyn-Sandys shows interest in the captain's cabin and water levels in Chapter 15, but not specifically in a dining room or wind speeds.
   d. ""encouraging Mr. Moggridge to thoroughly inspect a suspicious chest"": This part contradicts Chapter 16, where Mrs. Goodwyn-Sandys manipulates Mr. Moggridge into not opening the chest for inspection.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is not objectively valid or meaningful. The claim suggests that Mrs. Goodwyn-Sandys is honest, but the chapter outlines and summary indicate otherwise.
   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as Mrs. Goodwyn-Sandys is portrayed as deceitful rather than honest.

Since 1a., 1c., 1d., 2a., and 2b. are not satisfied, the claim is INVALID."
