In the early 19th century, Colonel Sir Thomas Nevil, an Irish officer in the English army, visits Marseilles with his daughter, Miss Lydia Nevil, after a tour in Italy. Lydia, disenchanted with the conventional tourist attractions, meets Lady Frances Fenwick, who possesses a sketch similar to one Lydia believed unique. This encounter frustrates Lydia, who is desperate to discover something novel. Meanwhile, Colonel Nevil, who sees the world through his daughter's eyes, shares her disillusionment with Italy.

At Hotel Beauveau, Colonel Nevil reunites with Captain Ellis, his former adjutant, who regales Lydia with tales of Corsica, including vendettas and bandits, captivating her imagination. Inspired by Ellis's stories, Lydia persuades her father to visit Corsica, a place untrodden by Englishwomen, where she hopes to find the local color and character she craves.

Upon arrival in Corsica, Orso della Rebbia, a lieutenant on half-pay, returns to his native village, Pietranera, burdened by his father's murder. Orso's father, Colonel Ghilfuccio della Rebbia, was killed under mysterious circumstances, and the Barricini family, their long-standing rivals, are suspected. Orso's sister, Colomba, is determined to avenge their father's death, urging Orso to uphold the family's honor.

Orso, torn between his sister's expectations and his own sense of justice, grapples with the island's traditions. He meets Miss Lydia Nevil, who, intrigued by Corsican customs and Orso's predicament, forms a bond with him. Lydia's presence and modern perspectives challenge Orso's Corsican instincts, leading him to question the vendetta's necessity.

Amidst this turmoil, Orso receives a letter from the prefect, revealing a confession from a man named Tomaso Bianchi, who claims responsibility for forging a letter that implicated the Barricini family in his father's death. Despite this revelation, Colomba remains unconvinced, believing the Barricini guilty and urging Orso to act.

As tensions rise, Orso encounters the Barricini brothers, Orlanduccio and Vincentello, leading to a confrontation. Orso, accused of seeking vengeance, finds himself embroiled in a duel with Orlanduccio, resulting in Orso's injury and the deaths of both Barricini brothers. Fleeing to the mountains, Orso is sheltered by bandits, including Brandolaccio and Giocanto Castriconi, who offer him refuge and assistance.

The prefect, sympathetic to Orso's plight, investigates the incident, gathering evidence to clear Orso's name. Meanwhile, Miss Lydia, who has developed feelings for Orso, becomes involved in the investigation, providing testimony that supports his claim of self-defense. Her involvement deepens her connection with Orso, leading to a mutual understanding and affection.

Ultimately, Orso is exonerated, and the vendetta is resolved without further bloodshed. Colomba, though initially driven by vengeance, finds peace in her brother's safe return and the prospect of a new beginning. Orso and Lydia, having navigated the complexities of Corsican culture and their own emotions, look forward to a future together, free from the shadows of the past.

The novel explores themes of tradition versus modernity, the impact of cultural customs on personal choices, and the power of love and understanding to bridge divides. Through Orso's journey, the story highlights the struggle between adhering to ancestral expectations and forging one's own path in a changing world.
