    a. Walter's description of a silver fortress in the moonlight: This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The outline mentions Walter describing a ""golden palace in the sunset"" (event 5), not a ""silver fortress in the moonlight.""

    a. The relationship is not meaningful or valid because the events described in the claim do not match the events in the chapter outline.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the described events do not occur.
