    b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly stated in the chapter outline.
    c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as it follows the events described in Chapter 27.

Since all atomic parts are grounded in the chapter outline, and the relationship between them is valid and meaningful, the claim is VALID.",INVALID,"1. Analysis of atomic parts:
    a. ""After sailing with all sails raised"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline. The outline mentions that the boys continue sailing with only the jib raised after seeking shelter in a cove (event 6), which contradicts the claim that they sailed with all sails raised.
    b. ""the boys find a cove far from their destination"": The chapter outline does not specify that the cove is far from their destination. It mentions that they find another cove near their destination (event 6).

    d. ""then climb a nearby hill and spot what appears to be their target house"": The chapter outline mentions that the group walks along the shore and spots what appears to be the house they're looking for (event 7), but it does not mention climbing a hill.

2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
    a. The relationship is not objectively valid because several parts of the claim are not grounded in the chapter outline or contradict it.
    b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly grounded in the summary or outline.
    c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline due to the contradictions and lack of grounding.
