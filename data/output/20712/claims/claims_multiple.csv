   a. ""Judge Thayer actively shapes Ascalon's development by encouraging settlers to leave the area"": This part is not grounded in the chapter outline or book summary. In fact, the bone collector mentions Judge Thayer encourages settlers to come to the area, which contradicts this part of the claim.
   b. ""offering Seth Craddock the position of city marshal"": This part is grounded in Chapter 2, events 5 and 6, where Judge Thayer offers Seth Craddock the position of city marshal.
   c. ""suggesting Calvin Morgan purchase a farm and become the town's newspaper editor"": This part is grounded in Chapter 4, event 3, where Judge Thayer offers Morgan a potential farm to purchase and suggests he consider becoming the town's newspaper editor.

   a. The relationship is not objectively valid because the first atomic part contradicts the information provided in the chapter outline and book summary. Judge Thayer does not encourage settlers to leave the area; rather, he encourages them to come.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation, but it is based on incorrect information.
   c. The relationship does not make sense based on the book summary and chapter outline due to the contradiction in the first atomic part.

Since the first atomic part is not grounded in the provided information and contradicts the chapter outline, the claim is INVALID."
