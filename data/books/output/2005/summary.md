The story unfolds in London, where Mr. Bingley Crocker, a wealthy American expatriate, is living with his wife, Mrs. Crocker, who is determined to integrate into English high society. Mr. Crocker, however, is homesick for America, especially during the baseball season. Their son, Jimmy Crocker, known in the tabloids as "Piccadilly Jim," is a notorious playboy whose antics embarrass his stepmother. 

Jimmy, who is actually not the real Jimmy Crocker, is impersonating him. The real Jimmy has run away to America to escape his stepmother's plans for him. The impersonator is in fact a con artist named Gentleman Jack, who is working with a gang to steal an explosive formula created by Will Partridge, Mrs. Crocker's nephew. 

Meanwhile, in New York, Mrs. Nesta Pett, Mrs. Crocker's sister, is hosting a gathering of intellectuals and artists. Her son, Ogden, is a troublesome child whom she dotes on. Ann Chester, Mrs. Pett's niece, is also present and expresses disdain for Jimmy Crocker, whom she met years ago and dislikes intensely. Ann is being courted by Lord Wisbeach, who is actually Gentleman Jack in disguise, aiming to steal the explosive formula.

Jimmy, feeling guilty about his past behavior and the trouble he's caused his father, decides to leave London for New York to make amends. He plans to adopt a new identity and start afresh, hoping to escape his reputation as Piccadilly Jim. On the ship to America, he meets Ann Chester and is immediately smitten, though she doesn't recognize him as the Jimmy Crocker she despises.

Upon arriving in New York, Jimmy learns that his father, Mr. Crocker, has taken a job as a butler in the Pett household, hoping to keep an eye on the explosive formula. Jimmy decides to infiltrate the Pett household as well, posing as a friend of Ann's, to protect the formula and win Ann's heart.

As the story progresses, Jimmy's true identity is revealed, leading to a series of comedic misunderstandings and adventures. He must navigate the complexities of his dual identity, deal with the scheming Gentleman Jack, and win over Ann, all while trying to prove himself as a reformed character.

In the end, Jimmy successfully exposes Gentleman Jack's plot, saves the explosive formula, and wins Ann's love. His father, Mr. Crocker, decides to return to America, abandoning the pursuit of a peerage, and the family reconciles. Jimmy's journey from a reckless playboy to a responsible and loving partner is complete, and he finds happiness and purpose in his new life with Ann.
