Bob and Jack Lakewood, two adventurous brothers, find themselves in a perilous situation aboard a ship that has struck an obstacle and is sinking. Amidst the chaos of passengers scrambling for lifeboats, they manage to help a young woman into a lifeboat and assist the ship's captain, who has fainted, into another lifeboat just before the ship goes down. As they row away, they struggle against a rising storm and icy waters, but their determination and resourcefulness keep them afloat. Eventually, they reach the shore, where they are rescued by a group of trappers who provide them with shelter and aid.

As they recover from their ordeal, the Lakewood brothers learn that the captain is severely ill with pneumonia, but under the care of the trappers, particularly Pierre, he begins to recover. The brothers, grateful for the trappers' hospitality, decide to continue their journey to find their missing uncle, Silas Lakewood, who disappeared during a prospecting trip in Alaska.

Their journey takes them to Nome, where they meet Captain Richard Blake, who is grateful to the brothers for saving his brother, the ship's captain. Captain Blake helps them secure a reliable guide, Lucky Hogan, an Indian with a reputation for trustworthiness. With Lucky's help, they prepare for the arduous journey up the Yukon River in search of their uncle.

The journey is fraught with challenges, including harsh weather, deep snow, and encounters with unfriendly individuals, such as a half-breed who attempts to shoot one of their dogs. Lucky's quick reflexes and strength save the day, and the group continues on, making slow but steady progress.

As they travel, they gather information about their uncle's possible whereabouts, learning that he was last seen with a man named Long, who has a dubious reputation. The brothers suspect foul play and are determined to find their uncle and uncover the truth.

The trail leads them to a remote cabin in the mountains, where they believe their uncle may have been held against his will. However, the cabin is deserted, and they find only a cryptic clue in the form of initials carved into the wall. The brothers and Lucky decide to wait and watch the cabin, hoping that someone will return and provide answers.

Their patience is rewarded when they encounter a small man who provides crucial information about seeing two men, one of whom was likely their uncle, in the area. With renewed hope, they set out to search for more clues, but their progress is hindered by a fierce blizzard and the presence of a pack of timber wolves.

Bob finds himself trapped by the wolves and takes refuge in a tree, but the cold and exhaustion take their toll, and he loses consciousness. Jack and Lucky, alerted by the sound of gunfire, arrive just in time to save him and drive off the wolves. They return to their camp, where Bob slowly recovers from his ordeal.

Determined to find their uncle, they return to the cabin to search for more clues. Despite the difficulties and dangers they face, the Lakewood brothers and Lucky remain resolute in their mission, driven by the hope of reuniting with their lost family member and uncovering the mystery surrounding his disappearance.

Their journey is a testament to their courage, resourcefulness, and the bonds of family and friendship that sustain them through the challenges of the Alaskan wilderness. As they continue their search, they hold onto the belief that they will find their uncle and bring him safely home.
