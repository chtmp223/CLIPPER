2. Analysis of the relationship between atomic parts:
   a. The relationship is objectively valid and meaningful. The lack of supervision logically leads to misbehavior, which in turn results in the formation of the Good-Conduct Club and interventions from their father.
   b. The relationship is not a subjective interpretation; it is explicitly supported by the events described in the summary and chapter outlines.
   c. The relationship makes sense based on the book summary and chapter outline, as the sequence of events and the causal connections are clearly established.

Since all considerations are satisfied, the claim is VALID."

   b. The relationship is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly stated in the summary or outline.
   c. The relationship does not contradict any information in the summary or outline, but it lacks explicit support.
