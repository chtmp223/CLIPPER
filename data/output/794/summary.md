The story unfolds with the Bastable children—Oswald, Dora, Dicky, Alice, Noel, and H. O.—navigating life in the countryside, where they are sent to learn to be good. Their adventures are filled with mischief, imagination, and a series of well-intentioned but often misguided attempts at noble deeds. The siblings, along with their friends Daisy and Denny, form a "Society of the Wouldbegoods" to try to improve themselves and perform acts of kindness, though their efforts frequently lead to chaos and unintended consequences.

Their adventures include trying to discover the source of a local stream, which they imagine as the Nile or the North Pole. This escapade involves building a dam, which inadvertently causes a flood that ruins a farmer's barley crop. The children are remorseful and face consequences, but they also learn valuable lessons about responsibility and the impact of their actions.

Another significant adventure involves the discovery of a baby in a perambulator, which Dora is convinced has been stolen by gipsies. The children "adopt" the baby, only to find out it belongs to the lodgers at the local mill. This leads to a mix-up that is eventually resolved, but not without a lecture on minding their own business.

The children's curiosity and sense of adventure also lead them to a mysterious tower, where they encounter a tramp and experience a frightful night locked inside. Their resourcefulness and bravery help them escape, and they learn the importance of caution and the potential danger of strangers.

One of the more dramatic incidents involves a fox hunt. The children, inspired by tales of hunting, set out to find a fox, only to discover a dead one in the woods. They decide to give it a proper burial, but are caught by a magistrate who accuses them of shooting the fox with a pistol they had secretly bought. The misunderstanding is cleared up when Denny confesses to accidentally shooting the fox while trying to free it from a trap. The children are forgiven, but they learn about the seriousness of handling firearms and the importance of honesty.

Throughout the story, the Bastable children are guided by their Uncle, who offers wisdom and discipline when needed. He acknowledges their good intentions and encourages them to continue striving to be better, despite their frequent mishaps. The narrative highlights the children's growth, their strong sibling bonds, and their earnest, if sometimes misguided, attempts to do good in the world.
