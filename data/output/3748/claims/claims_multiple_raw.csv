"The expedition's ability to navigate using a compass deteriorates as they progress deeper into the Earth, with the magnetic pole's behavior changing near the Liedenbrock Sea and the compass ceasing to function properly during their rapid ascent through a volcanic shaft.","The expedition's ability to navigate using a compass improves as they progress deeper into the Earth, with the magnetic pole's behavior becoming more stable near the Liedenbrock Sea and the compass functioning perfectly during their rapid ascent through a volcanic shaft.","In Chapter 31, the uncle notes the magnetic pole's unusual behavior. Later, in Chapter 35, the narrator observes that the compass has stopped functioning properly. Finally, in Chapter 45, Axel discovers that the compass poles are reversed due to an electric storm in the Liedenbrock Sea. This progression shows how the expedition's navigation tools become increasingly unreliable as they journey deeper into the Earth and encounter unusual electromagnetic phenomena.","This corrupted fact incorrectly states that the compass's functionality improves and becomes more stable as they journey deeper, which directly contradicts the information provided in the chapter outlines about the deteriorating reliability of the compass.","Chapter 31, 35, 45","- Chapter 31, item 4: Uncle provides geographical information about their location, including their distance from Iceland and the magnetic pole's behavior.
- Chapter 35, item 7: The narrator notices that the compass has ceased to function properly, adding to their growing anxiety about their situation.
- Chapter 45, item 7: Axel discovers that the compass's poles are reversed, leading to the realization that an electric storm in the Liedenbrock sea caused the magnetization of the iron and the reversal of the compass poles.
