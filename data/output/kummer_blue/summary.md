In the opening chapter, we are introduced to the tranquil life of Richard Duvall and his wife, Grace Ellicott Duvall, who are enjoying their honeymoon on a picturesque farm in southern Maryland. Richard, a former detective known for his skill in tracking international criminals, has temporarily retired from his profession to embrace the peaceful life of a country gentleman. The couple is deeply in love, and their contentment is palpable as they immerse themselves in the joys of managing their estate.

Their idyllic existence is disrupted by the unexpected arrival of Thomas Hodgman, a secretary to John Stapleton, a wealthy New York banker. Hodgman urgently seeks Richard's help in a case of kidnapping. Stapleton's only child has been abducted in Paris, and the banker is desperate for Richard's expertise. Despite his reluctance to return to detective work, Richard is persuaded by the gravity of the situation and Grace's encouragement to assist Stapleton.

Richard departs for New York with Hodgman, leaving Grace behind to manage the farm. Meanwhile, Grace receives a mysterious message from Monsieur Lefevre, the Prefect of Police in Paris, requesting her assistance in a case. Intrigued and sensing a connection to Richard's new assignment, Grace decides to surprise her husband by joining him in Paris.

Upon arrival in Paris, Grace meets with Monsieur Lefevre, who reveals that he had also intended to seek Richard's help in the same kidnapping case. However, Richard is already working for Stapleton. Lefevre proposes that Grace work independently on the case, using her intuition and skills to find the missing child. Grace agrees, intrigued by the challenge and the opportunity to work alongside her husband, albeit unknowingly.

Grace's investigations lead her to various clues, including a box of gold-tipped cigarettes found in the possession of Alphonse Valentin, a former chauffeur of the Stapletons and a suspect in the kidnapping. She also encounters a mysterious man with a black beard, who seems to be involved in the crime. As she delves deeper, Grace discovers a complex web of deceit involving several individuals, including the Stapleton's nurse, Mary Lanahan, and the chauffeur, François.

Meanwhile, Richard is conducting his own investigation, focusing on the same suspects and trying to unravel the mystery of the kidnapping. Both he and Grace are unaware of each other's presence in Paris, leading to a series of near encounters and misunderstandings.

The case takes a dangerous turn when Grace is abducted by the kidnappers, who use her to deliver a ransom demand to John Stapleton. Despite the peril, Grace remains determined to find the child and bring the criminals to justice.

In a climactic sequence, both Richard and Grace, working separately, manage to uncover the truth behind the kidnapping. They discover that the crime was orchestrated by a group of criminals, including Valentin and François, who used the gold-tipped cigarettes to drug Mary Lanahan and abduct the child without her knowledge.

In a daring plan, Grace and Richard collaborate to capture the kidnappers and rescue the child. Their efforts are successful, and the child is safely returned to the Stapletons. The criminals are apprehended, and the mystery of the kidnapping is resolved.

The novel concludes with Richard and Grace reunited, their love and partnership strengthened by the challenges they faced. They return to their beloved farm in Maryland, ready to resume their peaceful life together, their bond unbroken and their honeymoon renewed.
